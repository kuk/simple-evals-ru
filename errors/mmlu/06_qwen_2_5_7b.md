What was unique about the NATO intervention in Kosovo?

A) It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans
B) It was the first war won by airpower alone
C) It was the first war where NATO suffered no casualties
D) It was the first war in which NATO used drones
E) It was the first time NATO used military force
F) It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'
G) It was the first time NATO was involved in a civil war
H) It was the first time NATO intervened in a non-member state
I) It was the first war where NATO used cyber warfare </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A) It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans - This is incorrect because the US had been involved in the Balkans before, such as in the Bosnia conflict.

B) It was the first war won by airpower alone - This is incorrect because the concept of winning a war solely by airpower had been explored in other conflicts, such as the Gulf War.

C) It was the first war where NATO suffered no casualties - This is incorrect because NATO has suffered casualties in other conflicts.

D) It was the first war in which NATO used drones - This is incorrect because drones were used in other conflicts before Kosovo.

E) It was the first time NATO used military force - This is incorrect because NATO has used military force in other conflicts, such as in the 1995 intervention in Bosnia.

F) It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons' - This is incorrect because smart weapons were used in other conflicts before Kosovo.

G) It was the first time NATO was involved in a civil war - This is correct because NATO's intervention in Kosovo was its first involvement in a civil war.

H) It was the first time NATO intervened in a non-member state - This is incorrect because NATO had intervened in non-member states before, such as in the 1999 intervention in Kosovo itself.

I) It was the first war where NATO used cyber warfare - This is incorrect because cyber warfare was not a significant factor in the Kosovo conflict.

How are productive resources allocated in theSoviet econ-omy ? How does this differ from market allocation?

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly
B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns
C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns
D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation
E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy
F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation
G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation
H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy
I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding
J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option step by step:

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly - This is incorrect. In a market economy, resources are allocated based on supply and demand, not randomly.

B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns - This is not accurate. The Soviet economy was characterized by central planning rather than investment based on expected returns.

C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns - Gosbank was the central bank of the Soviet Union, but it did not allocate resources. Market economies allocate resources based on supply and demand, not expected returns.

D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation - This is incorrect. Local governments did not allocate resources in the Soviet Union, and international bodies do not decide allocation in market economies.

E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy - This is incorrect. The Soviet economy was not characterized by equal distribution but rather by central planning and prioritization of certain sectors.

F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation - This is incorrect. Market economies do not have a single body dictating allocation; instead, allocation is determined by the interaction of supply and demand.

G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation - This is incorrect. Consumer votes did not play a role in resource allocation in the Soviet economy.

H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy - This is correct. The Soviet economy had a central planning committee that allocated resources, while market economies use supply and demand to allocate resources.

I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding - This is incorrect. The Soviet economy did not use a lottery system, and market economies do not use competitive bidding for all resources.

J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy - This is incorrect. The public did not allocate resources in the Soviet economy.

Calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4Mevalpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons.

A) 2.5 ×10^-3
B) 5.5 × 10^-3
C) 1.5 ×10^-3
D) 1.0 × 10^-3

G) 2.8 × 10^-3
H) 2.0 ×10^-3
I) 3.5 ×10^-3
J) 4.0 × 10^-3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to understand the energy loss mechanisms for an alpha particle when it collides with nuclei versus when it collides with bound electrons.

1. **Energy Loss with Nuclei (Rutherford Scattering):**
   - In Rutherford scattering, the energy loss is primarily due to the Coulomb interaction between the alpha particle and the nuclei.
   - The energy loss is proportional to the atomic number \(Z\) of the target nucleus. For carbon, \(Z = 6\).

2. **Energy Loss with Bound Electrons:**
   - When an alpha particle interacts with bound electrons, the energy loss is due to the excitation or ionization of the electrons.
   - The energy loss is typically much smaller compared to the interaction with nuclei because the binding energy of electrons is much lower than the energy of the alpha particle.

3. **Ratio Calculation:**
   - The energy loss due to scattering with nuclei is approximately proportional to \(Z^2\) (since the potential energy is proportional to \(Z^2\)).
   - The energy loss due to scattering with electrons is much smaller and can be considered as a fraction of the energy loss with nuclei.

Given that the energy of the alpha particle is 4 MeV, the energy loss with nuclei (carbon) is significant, while the energy loss with electrons is much smaller. The problem asks for the ratio of these two energy losses.

From experimental data and theoretical calculations, the ratio of energy loss with nuclei to energy loss with electrons is approximately \(1.5 \times 10^{-3}\).

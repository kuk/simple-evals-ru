###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, we first need to understand how resources are allocated in a Soviet-style economy versus a market economy.

In a Soviet-style economy, which is a form of planned economy, resources are allocated by a central planning committee. This committee decides how resources should be distributed among different sectors of the economy based on the government's priorities and goals, rather than based on market forces like supply and demand.

On the other hand, in a market economy, resources are allocated through the interaction of supply and demand in the market. Businesses and individuals make decisions about how to allocate resources based on expected returns and consumer demand, rather than through central planning.

With these principles in mind, let's look at the options:

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly - This is incorrect because resource allocation in a market economy is based on supply and demand, not randomness.

B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns - While the Soviet government might consider expected returns, the primary method of resource allocation is through central planning, not solely based on expected financial returns.

C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns - Gosbank was the central bank of the Soviet Union, but saying it allocates resources simplifies the role of central planning in the Soviet economy. Additionally, while expected returns play a role in market economies, this option doesn't fully capture the role of supply and demand.

D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation - This is incorrect because, in a Soviet economy, resource allocation is typically done by a central planning committee at the national level, not local governments. In a market economy, resource allocation is not decided by international bodies.

E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy - This is not accurate. While the Soviet economy aimed for equitable distribution in some aspects, resource allocation was based on central planning priorities, not an equal distribution across all industries.

F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation - This is incorrect because, in a market economy, no single body dictates resource allocation; instead, allocation is determined by the interactions of many individuals and businesses.

G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation - This is not accurate. Soviet economies allocate resources through central planning, not consumer votes. In market economies, while producers play a role in deciding where to allocate resources, the ultimate allocation is influenced by both supply and demand.

H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy - This option accurately describes the difference between how resources are allocated in a Soviet-style economy (through central planning) and in a market economy (through the interaction of supply and demand).

I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding - This is incorrect. The Soviet economy uses central planning, not a lottery system, for resource allocation. While competitive bidding can be a feature of some market mechanisms, it's not the primary way resource allocation is described in market economies.

J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy - This is not accurate. Resource allocation in a Soviet economy is done by a central planning committee, not directly by the public.

###### answer
<pre> To calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4 MeV alpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons, we need to understand the basic principles of energy loss in these interactions.

The energy loss of a charged particle (like an alpha particle) as it travels through a material is primarily due to two mechanisms: 
1. Nuclear collisions (or scattering), where the alpha particle interacts with the nuclei of the material.
2. Electronic collisions, where the alpha particle interacts with the electrons of the material.

The energy loss per unit path length due to nuclear collisions can be described by the nuclear stopping power, and the energy loss due to electronic collisions can be described by the electronic stopping power.

For alpha particles, which are heavy charged particles, the energy loss due to electronic collisions is much greater than the energy loss due to nuclear collisions. This is because alpha particles can easily ionize atoms by stripping away electrons, leading to a significant energy transfer in electronic collisions.

However, the question asks for the ratio of energy loss due to nuclear collisions to that due to electronic collisions. This ratio is typically small because nuclear collisions are less frequent and less effective at transferring energy compared to electronic collisions for particles like alpha particles.

The exact calculation of this ratio involves complex formulas that depend on the energy of the alpha particle, the atomic number and mass of the target material (carbon in this case), and other factors. However, given the options provided and without specific details on how to calculate this ratio directly from first principles in this format, we must rely on general knowledge about the interaction of charged particles with matter.

Given that the energy loss to electrons is significantly larger than to nuclei for alpha particles, the ratio should be small. Among the provided options, all are small, reflecting the expectation that energy loss to nuclei is less efficient than to electrons. Without a precise calculation method provided or specific constants and formulas to apply, selecting the correct answer requires an understanding that this ratio is indeed small but not zero.

Given the typical ranges and considering the general principles of particle interactions with matter, a ratio in the order of \(10^{-3}\) seems plausible for the energy loss due to nuclear collisions compared to electronic collisions for a 4 MeV alpha particle in carbon. The most accurate answer would depend on detailed calculations involving the stopping powers for nuclear and electronic interactions, which are not provided here.

Given the context and the need for a step-by-step logical deduction without explicit calculation steps provided for each option, and acknowledging that all options suggest a small ratio which aligns with expectations, the selection must consider what is typically known about such interactions.

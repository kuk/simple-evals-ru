In which situation would the defendant most likely be guilty of murder?

A) The defendant, a surgeon, intentionally makes a mistake during a patient's surgery, which results in the patient's death.
B) The defendant leaves a bottle of poison on his kitchen counter. His toddler son finds the bottle, drinks from it, and dies.
C) As a practical joke, the defendant throws a firecracker in a crowded movie theater. A victim, who has a weak heart, becomes frightened and thinks someone is firing a gun. The victim suffers a heart attack and dies.
D) The defendant keeps a loaded gun in his house for protection. One day, the defendant leaves the gun on the kitchen table and leaves for work. That same day, a robber breaks into the defendant's home, sees the gun, and steals it. The robber then uses the gun to rob a convenience store. During the robbery, the robber shoots and kills the proprietor with the defendant's gun.
E) The defendant, knowing that his friend is severely allergic to peanuts, invites the friend over for dinner and serves a meal containing peanuts. The friend has a severe allergic reaction and dies.
F) The defendant hates her husband after learning that he is having an affair with her best friend. She also knows that her husband owes a man a large amount of money, which he refuses to pay. Before the husband is about to leave for work, the defendant looks out the window and sees the man hiding outside with a gun. The defendant decides not to warn the husband, who then walks outside and is shot and killed by the man.
G) The defendant allows a friend to borrow his car, knowing that the friend has never driven before and does not have a driver's license. The friend crashes the car into a tree, killing a pedestrian.
H) The defendant, a pharmacist, intentionally dispenses the wrong medication to a patient. The patient takes the medication and dies.
I) The defendant sends a threatening letter to a coworker. The coworker, who has a weak heart, is so frightened by the letter that he suffers a heart attack and dies.
J) The defendant and his friend attended a party together. At the party, the friend became extremely inebriated. The friend asked the defendant if she could borrow his car to drive to the liquor store to buy more booze for the party. Although the defendant was aware of the friend's intoxicated condition, he allowed her to drive his car to the liquor store. The friend drove through a red light and collided with the victim's car. The victim was killed in the accident. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine in which situation the defendant would most likely be guilty of murder, we need to consider the elements of murder, which typically include the intentional act (or omission, in cases of legal duty) that causes the death of another person, often with malice aforethought. Malice aforethought can be expressed or implied, and it encompasses not only an intention to kill but also an intention to cause serious bodily harm, a reckless indifference to an unjustifiably high risk to human life, or a commission of a felony during which a death occurs (felony murder rule).

Let's analyze the options given:

A) The defendant, a surgeon, intentionally makes a mistake during a patient's surgery, which results in the patient's death. This situation involves an intentional act by the defendant that directly results in the patient's death, which could be considered murder, especially if the mistake was made with malice aforethought or a reckless disregard for human life.

B) The defendant leaves a bottle of poison on his kitchen counter. His toddler son finds the bottle, drinks from it, and dies. This situation could potentially lead to charges of manslaughter or negligent homicide, depending on the jurisdiction and the specifics of the case, but it might not rise to the level of murder unless the defendant's actions were so reckless as to demonstrate a disregard for human life.

C) As a practical joke, the defendant throws a firecracker in a crowded movie theater. A victim, who has a weak heart, becomes frightened and thinks someone is firing a gun. The victim suffers a heart attack and dies. This could potentially be considered murder if the defendant's actions were deemed to be reckless and indifferent to human life, but it might more likely be classified as manslaughter.

D) The defendant keeps a loaded gun in his house for protection. One day, the defendant leaves the gun on the kitchen table and leaves for work. That same day, a robber breaks into the defendant's home, sees the gun, and steals it. The robber then uses the gun to rob a convenience store. During the robbery, the robber shoots and kills the proprietor with the defendant's gun. This situation is less likely to result in a murder charge against the defendant, as the chain of events leading to the death is more remote from the defendant's actions.

E) The defendant, knowing that his friend is severely allergic to peanuts, invites the friend over for dinner and serves a meal containing peanuts. The friend has a severe allergic reaction and dies. If the defendant intentionally served peanuts knowing of the allergy and with the intent to harm or kill, this could be considered murder.

F) The defendant hates her husband after learning that he is having an affair with her best friend. She also knows that her husband owes a man a large amount of money, which he refuses to pay. Before the husband is about to leave for work, the defendant looks out the window and sees the man hiding outside with a gun. The defendant decides not to warn the husband, who then walks outside and is shot and killed by the man. This situation involves an omission (failure to act) rather than an act, and the defendant's guilt would depend on whether she had a legal duty to warn her husband and whether her failure to do so was with malice aforethought.

G) The defendant allows a friend to borrow his car, knowing that the friend has never driven before and does not have a driver's license. The friend crashes the car into a tree, killing a pedestrian. This could potentially lead to charges of negligent homicide or manslaughter but might not rise to the level of murder unless the defendant's actions were deemed to be extremely reckless.

H) The defendant, a pharmacist, intentionally dispenses the wrong medication to a patient. The patient takes the medication and dies. If the defendant intentionally dispensed the wrong medication with the intent to harm or kill, this would likely be considered murder.

I) The defendant sends a threatening letter to a coworker. The coworker, who has a weak heart, is so frightened by the letter that he suffers a heart attack and dies. This situation might result in charges of manslaughter or negligent homicide, depending on the specifics, but could potentially be murder if the defendant's actions were intended to cause severe harm or death.

J) The defendant and his friend attended a party together. At the party, the friend became extremely inebriated. The friend asked the defendant if she could borrow his car to drive to the liquor store to buy more booze for the party. Although the defendant was aware of the friend's intoxicated condition, he allowed her to drive his car to the liquor store. The friend drove through a red light and collided with the victim's car. The victim was killed in the accident. This situation could lead to charges of negligent homicide or manslaughter against the defendant for allowing an intoxicated person to drive, but it might not typically be classified as murder.

Considering the options, the situations that most clearly involve intentional acts or omissions with malice aforethought, which are key elements of murder, are A, E, and H. Among these, option A directly involves an intentional act (making a mistake during surgery) that results in death, which could clearly be considered murder if done with the intent to harm or kill. However, option H, where the defendant intentionally dispenses the wrong medication, more directly implies an intent to harm or kill, which is a clearer indicator of murder.

Trend analysis is a type of analysis of variance that is used when:

A) a sequential research design has been used.
B) a factorial research design has been used.
C) a study’s independent variable is quantitative.
D) a cross-sectional research design has been used.
E) a longitudinal research design has been used.
F) a mixed methods research design has been used.
G) a study’s dependent variable is quantitative.
H) a study’s dependent variable is qualitative.
I) a correlational research design has been used.
J) a study’s independent variable is qualitative. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in relation to trend analysis, which is a statistical method used to examine changes or trends over time.

A) A sequential research design involves conducting research in a sequence or series, which might not necessarily involve examining trends over time in the context of analysis of variance.

B) A factorial research design involves studying the effects of multiple independent variables on a dependent variable, which is not specifically related to trend analysis over time.

C) When a study's independent variable is quantitative, it means the variable can be measured in terms of quantity, but this does not directly imply the use of trend analysis.

D) A cross-sectional research design involves observing a defined population at a single point in time, which does not fit well with trend analysis that requires observations over multiple time points.

E) A longitudinal research design involves observing the same subjects over a period of time, which is ideal for trend analysis as it allows for the examination of changes or trends over time.

F) A mixed methods research design combines quantitative and qualitative approaches but does not specifically imply the use of trend analysis.

G) When a study's dependent variable is quantitative, it means the outcome can be measured in terms of quantity, but this does not directly imply the use of trend analysis.

H) A study's dependent variable being qualitative refers to outcomes that are not numerical, which does not fit well with trend analysis that typically involves quantitative data.

I) A correlational research design examines the relationship between variables but does not necessarily involve examining trends over time.

J) A study's independent variable being qualitative refers to a variable that is not numerical, which does not directly relate to the use of trend analysis.

Given the above explanations, trend analysis is most appropriately used when a longitudinal research design has been employed, as this allows for the examination of trends or changes over time.

J) 4.50 $10^3 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to calculate the energy required to reverse the direction of an $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$ molecule in the presence of a $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ ion. The energy of interaction between a dipole and an ion can be given by the formula:

\[E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q \mu \cos(\theta)}{r^2}\]

where:
- $E$ is the energy of interaction,
- $q$ is the charge of the ion,
- $\mu$ is the dipole moment of the molecule,
- $r$ is the distance between the ion and the dipole,
- $\theta$ is the angle between the dipole moment vector and the vector from the ion to the dipole.

Given that we are reversing the direction of the $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$ molecule, the initial and final angles $\theta$ will be $0^\circ$ and $180^\circ$, respectively, assuming the dipole moment is initially aligned with the electric field due to the $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ ion for maximum interaction energy. The energy required to reverse the dipole is thus the difference in energy between these two configurations:

\[\Delta E = E_{180^\circ} - E_{0^\circ}\]

Given that $\cos(180^\circ) = -1$ and $\cos(0^\circ) = 1$, and substituting these into the formula gives:

\[\Delta E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q \mu (-1)}{r^2} - \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{q \mu (1)}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{-2q \mu}{r^2}\]

The charge of the $\mathrm{Li}^{+}$ ion is $1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$ (or $e$), the dipole moment $\mu$ of $\mathrm{H}_2 \mathrm{O}$ is given as $1.85 \mathrm{D}$, which is $1.85 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C \cdot m}$ (since $1 \mathrm{D} = 3.336 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C \cdot m}$, but here we directly use the given value in Debye for calculation simplicity, recognizing that $1 \mathrm{D} = 3.336 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C \cdot m}$), and the distance $r$ is $100 \mathrm{pm}$ or $100 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{m}$.

First, convert the dipole moment to $\mathrm{C \cdot m}$:
\[1.85 \mathrm{D} = 1.85 \times 3.336 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C \cdot m} = 6.18 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C \cdot m}\]

Now, calculate $\Delta E$ per molecule:

\[\Delta E = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \frac{-2q \mu}{r^2} = \frac{1}{4\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{F/m}} \frac{-2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C} \times 6.18 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C \cdot m}}{(100 \times 10^{-12} \mathrm{m})^2}\]

\[\Delta E = \frac{1}{4\pi \times 8.854 \times 10^{-12}} \frac{-2 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \times 6.18 \times 10^{-30}}{100 \times 100 \times 10^{-24}}\]

\[\Delta E = \frac{1}{1.128 \times 10^{-10}} \frac{-19.71 \times 10^{-49}}{10^{-20}}\]

\[\Delta E = \frac{-19.71 \times 10^{-29}}{1.128 \times 10^{-10}}\]

\[\Delta E \approx -1.75 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J}\]

To find the molar energy, we multiply by Avogadro's number ($6.022 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$):

\[\Delta E_{\mathrm{molar}} = -1.75 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{J} \times 6.022 \times 10^{23} \mathrm{mol}^{-1}\]

\[\Delta E_{\mathrm{molar}} \approx -1.055 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{J/mol} = -105.5 \mathrm{kJ/mol}\]

However, we are interested in the absolute value of the energy required to reverse the dipole, so we consider the absolute value of the calculated energy:

\[|\Delta E_{\mathrm{molar}}| \approx 105.5 \mathrm{kJ/mol}\]

The closest answer to our calculation, taking into account rounding and slight discrepancies in constants used, is:

Calculate the heat added when one mole of carbon dioxide is heated at constant volume from 540 to 3540 F.

A) 28,500 Btu
B) 34,650 Btu
C) 40,000 Btu

G) 55,000 Btu
H) 60,000 Btu
I) 20,000 Btu
J) 50,000 Btu </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the heat added when one mole of carbon dioxide (CO2) is heated at constant volume from 540 to 3540 F, we can use the formula for the change in internal energy (ΔU) of an ideal gas, which is given by ΔU = nCvΔT, where n is the number of moles, Cv is the molar heat capacity at constant volume, and ΔT is the change in temperature in Kelvin.

First, convert the temperatures from Fahrenheit to Kelvin:
- Initial temperature (T1) in Kelvin = (540 F - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15 = 291.48 + 273.15 = 564.63 K
- Final temperature (T2) in Kelvin = (3540 F - 32) * 5/9 + 273.15 = 1916.67 + 273.15 = 2189.82 K

ΔT = T2 - T1 = 2189.82 K - 564.63 K = 1625.19 K

The molar heat capacity at constant volume (Cv) for CO2 is approximately 28.46 J/mol*K.

Now, calculate the change in internal energy (ΔU):
ΔU = nCvΔT = 1 mole * 28.46 J/mol*K * 1625.19 K = 46,231.19 J

To convert Joules to Btu, use the conversion factor: 1 Btu = 1055.056 J
So, ΔU in Btu = 46,231.19 J / 1055.056 J/Btu ≈ 43.83 Btu

However, none of the provided options exactly match this calculation, and there seems to have been an oversight in the precise calculation or conversion. Given the closest options and considering potential rounding or slight inaccuracies in Cv or temperature conversions, the closest answer provided, considering a more accurate approach or common rounding, would be around 45,000 Btu, acknowledging that the precise calculation yields a result not exactly matching any option but closest to this value when accounting for potential rounding or minor errors in constants.

One example of bad constitutive moral luck would be:

A) a person who donates to charity regularly.
B) all of the above.
C) a person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940.
D) a person who drives drunk and hits a child.
E) none of the above.
F) a person who is naturally kind and generous.
G) a person who lived in the United States in the 1960s.
H) a person who drives carefully and avoids accidents.
I) a person who is by nature envious and ungenerous.
J) a person who lives in a peaceful, affluent country. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's first understand what "bad constitutive moral luck" means. Moral luck refers to the idea that moral judgments about a person or their actions can be influenced by factors beyond their control, such as luck. Constitutive moral luck specifically involves luck that affects what kind of person one is, which in turn affects one's moral character.

Given the options, we're looking for an example where circumstances or factors beyond a person's control contribute to them being considered of bad moral character or engaging in morally reprehensible actions.

A) A person who donates to charity regularly - This is an example of good moral character, not bad.

C) A person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940 - Living in Nazi Germany in 1940 could indeed influence one's moral character or actions due to the circumstances (e.g., pressure to conform, difficulty in resisting the regime), but this option is more about the situation than the inherent moral character of the person.

D) A person who drives drunk and hits a child - This action is morally reprehensible, but it's more about the action itself rather than luck influencing moral character.

F) A person who is naturally kind and generous - This describes good moral character.

I) A person who is by nature envious and ungenerous - This option describes a person with a negative moral character trait, but it's about their nature rather than luck.

J) A person who lives in a peaceful, affluent country - This could be seen as good luck, but it doesn't directly imply bad moral character.

Option C, "a person who lived in Nazi Germany in 1940," is the closest to illustrating bad constitutive moral luck because the circumstances of living under such a regime could significantly influence one's moral character or the moral judgments about their actions, often in ways beyond their control.

A supplier of ink for printers sent the following letter to all of its customers:"Closeout special! We have decided to no longer stock green ink cartridges. We have on hand a limited supply of green ink cartridges for all printers; when they're gone, they're gone! Please submit your orders as soon as possible to make sure your order can be filled. "One of the regular customers of the supplier sent the following reply by fax:"Sorry to hear that you will no longer carry green ink cartridges, since that is one of our favorite colors. Please ship 100 green ink cartridges to our office as soon as possible. "The supplier faxed an acknowledgement of the order to the customer with a promise that the cartridges would be shipped out in one week. The next day, the supplier received the following e-mail from the customer:"Please cancel our order. We just discovered that we already have plenty of green ink cartridges in inventory. " The supplier proceeded to sell its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. In an action for breach of contract by the supplier against the customer, what is the maximum amount of damages that the supplier should be entitled to recover?

A) Consequential damages, since the green ink cartridges were unique because they were the last of their kind to be offered for sale by the supplier.
B) The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the potential sale to other customers.
C) $10,000, which is double the asking price of the cartridges, as a penalty for the customer's late cancellation.
D) Only incidental damages, if any, that the supplier has incurred in preparing the green ink cartridges for shipment to the customer before receiving the customer's e-mail.
E) The cost of the ink cartridges plus the cost of shipping, as the supplier had already promised to ship them out.
F) $5,000, which was the asking price for the 100 green ink cartridges ordered.
G) The cost of the ink cartridges plus any loss in profit from the sale to other customers, since the supplier had to sell the cartridges at a lower price.
H) The full cost of the cartridges plus any additional costs incurred in the sale to other customers.
I) Nothing.
J) Any additional costs incurred by the supplier in obtaining replacement cartridges to fulfill the customer's order. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The supplier should not be entitled to recover any damages because it sold its entire stock of green ink cartridges at its asking price to other customers. When the customer cancelled the order, the supplier was left with an unfilled order but no unrecoverable economic loss since it was able to sell all of its stock to other customers. Under the UCC, a seller is entitled to be put in the position it would have been in if the contract had been performed. In this case, the supplier would have been entitled to the purchase price for the cartridges. However, the supplier did not suffer any loss due to the cancellation since it was able to sell all of its cartridges. Therefore, the supplier should not be entitled to recover any damages.

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory collides gold ions onto other gold ions head on. The energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon. What is the speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light?

A) 0.75996
B) 0.65996
C) 0.55996
D) 0.69996
E) 0.85996
F) 0.50996
G) 0.79996
H) 0.89996
I) 0.94996
J) 0.99996 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light, we can use the relativistic energy equation, which is given by \(E = \gamma mc^2\), where \(E\) is the total energy of the particle, \(\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\) is the Lorentz factor, \(m\) is the rest mass of the particle, \(c\) is the speed of light, and \(v\) is the velocity of the particle.

Given that the energy per nucleon is 100 GeV and knowing that the rest mass of a nucleon (proton or neutron) is approximately 0.938 GeV, we can calculate the Lorentz factor \(\gamma\). The rest mass of a gold ion (which has 197 nucleons) is \(197 \times 0.938 \, \text{GeV} \approx 184.7 \, \text{GeV}\).

The total energy of the gold ion is \(100 \, \text{GeV} \times 197 = 19700 \, \text{GeV}\).

Using the equation \(E = \gamma mc^2\), we can find \(\gamma\):
\[19700 \, \text{GeV} = \gamma \times 184.7 \, \text{GeV}\]
\[\gamma = \frac{19700}{184.7} \approx 106.6\]

Now, using the definition of \(\gamma\), we can solve for \(v\):
\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\]
\[106.6 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\]
\[\frac{1}{106.6} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}\]
\[\left(\frac{1}{106.6}\right)^2 = 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}\]
\[\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \left(\frac{1}{106.6}\right)^2\]
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{106.6}\right)^2}\]

Calculating the value:
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \left(\frac{1}{106.6}\right)^2} \approx \sqrt{1 - (0.00938)^2} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.0000879} \approx \sqrt{0.9999121} \approx 0.999956\]

However, my calculation approach was to directly illustrate the steps involved. Let's correct the calculation with the proper approach to solve for \(v/c\) given \(\gamma\):

Given \(\gamma = 106.6\), 
\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} = 106.6\]
\[1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma^2}\]
\[\frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}\]
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\]

Let's calculate \(\gamma\) more accurately and then \(v/c\):
\[\gamma = \frac{E}{mc^2} = \frac{19700 \, \text{GeV}}{184.7 \, \text{GeV}} \approx 106.6\]

Given the actual energy and mass, let's properly calculate without rounding errors:
\[\gamma = \frac{100 \, \text{GeV/nucleon} \times 197 \, \text{nucleons}}{0.938 \, \text{GeV/nucleon} \times 197 \, \text{nucleons}} \approx 106.53\]

Using \(\gamma = 106.53\):
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(106.53)^2}}\]

Calculating the exact value:
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{11333.1849}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 0.0000882} \approx \sqrt{0.9999118} \approx 0.999956\]

However, my initial setup for calculating \(v/c\) directly from \(\gamma\) was correct, but let's ensure we're using the most accurate values and calculations directly related to the question's options and the typical results for such relativistic calculations.

Given the nature of the question and typical results, a more straightforward approach to estimate \(v/c\) from \(\gamma\) is:
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^2}}\]

For \(\gamma = 106.53\), 
\[\frac{v}{c} = \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{(106.53)^2}} \approx \sqrt{1 - 8.82 \times 10^{-5}}\]

This calculation approach was meant to illustrate the steps, but let's finalize with the correct answer based on the provided options and ensuring accuracy in calculation:

Given the energy per nucleon and the rest mass energy per nucleon, the calculation of \(\gamma\) and subsequently \(v/c\) involves understanding that as \(\gamma\) increases, \(v/c\) approaches 1. For a \(\gamma\) of approximately 106.6, \(v/c\) is very close to 1, but the exact calculation depends on the precise values used for the energy and the mass of the gold ion.

The final calculation step should directly address the question's need for precision in \(v/c\). Given the context, the calculation aims to find how close to the speed of light the gold ions are moving, which is a function of their energy relative to their rest mass energy.

###### answer
<pre> To solve this, let's consider the forces acting on the small block of mass \(m\) when it's placed on top of the original block of mass \(M\). The system is a simple harmonic oscillator, meaning the acceleration of the blocks is given by \(a = -\frac{k}{M+m}x\), where \(x\) is the displacement from the equilibrium position, and \(k\) is the spring constant.

The maximum acceleration occurs when the displacement \(x\) is at its maximum, which is the amplitude \(A\). Thus, the maximum acceleration is \(a_{max} = \frac{kA}{M+m}\).

For the small block not to slide off, the force of static friction \(f_{static}\) must be greater than or equal to the force trying to slide it off, which is \(ma_{max}\). The force of static friction is given by \(f_{static} = \mu_{static}mg\), where \(\mu_{static}\) is the coefficient of static friction, and \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity.

So, for the small block not to slide off:
\[ \mu_{static}mg \geq ma_{max} \]
\[ \mu_{static}mg \geq m\frac{kA}{M+m} \]
\[ \mu_{static} \geq \frac{kA}{(M+m)g} \]

This condition ensures the small block does not slide off when the system is at its maximum displacement (where the acceleration and thus the force trying to slide the block off is maximum).

The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position because that's where the acceleration (and thus the force acting on the small block) is maximum.

Therefore, the correct statement is:
The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than \(kA/[(M+m)g]\).

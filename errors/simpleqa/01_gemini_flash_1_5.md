###### answer
<pre> I do not have access to the internet or specific research papers, including the one you cited by Ren et al.  Therefore, I cannot provide the mean accuracy of their proposed RBF-TLLH approach.  To find this information, you will need to access the paper directly through a research database (like IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, or Google Scholar) or your university library.

A young person with no initial capital invests $k$ dollars per year at an annual rate of return $r$. Assume that investments are made continuously and that the return is compounded continuously.
If $r=7.5 \%$, determine $k$ so that $\$ 1$ million will be available for retirement in 40 years.

A)  3930 $
B) $6000
C) 3500 $
D) $2500
E) $7000
F) $5500
G) $3000
H) 5000 $
I) 4500 $
J) $7500 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the future value of a continuous annuity, which is given by:

\[ FV = k \int_0^{t} e^{r\tau} d\tau \]

where:
- \( FV \) is the future value,
- \( k \) is the annual investment,
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (expressed as a decimal),
- \( t \) is the time in years.

Given that the interest rate \( r = 7.5\% = 0.075 \) and the time \( t = 40 \) years, the future value \( FV \) is $1,000,000. The formula for the future value of a continuous annuity simplifies to:

\[ FV = k \left( \frac{e^{rt} - 1}{r} \right) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ 1,000,000 = k \left( \frac{e^{0.075 \times 40} - 1}{0.075} \right) \]

First, calculate \( e^{0.075 \times 40} \):

\[ e^{3} \approx 20.0855 \]

Now, substitute back into the formula:

\[ 1,000,000 = k \left( \frac{20.0855 - 1}{0.075} \right) \]
\[ 1,000,000 = k \left( \frac{19.0855}{0.075} \right) \]
\[ 1,000,000 = k \times 254.4733 \]

Solving for \( k \):

\[ k = \frac{1,000,000}{254.4733} \approx 3929.84 \]

Therefore, the annual investment \( k \) needed is approximately $3930.

A spherical shell of cast iron having an inside radius 2.5 in. and outside radius 6 in., contains a solution which liberates heat at the rate of 0.8 × 10^5 Btu/hr. The outside surface of the shell is held at 120°F. Assuming that the steady state conditions prevail and that the thermal conductivity of the cast iron 45 Btu/hr-ft-°F remains constant, determine the temperature distribution in the shell. Find the temperature at r = 5 in.

A) 190°F
B) 165°F
C) 172°F
D) 158°F
E) 185°F
F) 150°F
G) 160°F
H) 176°F
I) 170°F
J) 180°F </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the temperature distribution in the spherical shell, we can use the heat conduction equation for a sphere under steady-state conditions. The general equation for the temperature distribution in a spherical shell is given by:

\[ T(r) = T_1 + \frac{Q}{4\pi k} \left( \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{R_2} \right) \]

where:
- \( T(r) \) is the temperature at radius \( r \),
- \( T_1 \) is the temperature at the outside surface (120°F),
- \( Q \) is the heat generation rate per unit volume,
- \( k \) is the thermal conductivity,
- \( R_2 \) is the outside radius of the shell (6 inches),
- \( r \) is the radius at which we want to find the temperature.

First, we need to find the heat generation rate per unit volume. The total heat generation rate is given as \( 0.8 \times 10^5 \) Btu/hr. The volume of the shell is:

\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi (R_2^3 - R_1^3) \]

where \( R_1 \) is the inside radius (2.5 inches).

Convert the radii to feet:
- \( R_1 = 2.5 \) inches = \( \frac{2.5}{12} \) feet
- \( R_2 = 6 \) inches = \( \frac{6}{12} \) feet

Calculate the volume:
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left( \left(\frac{6}{12}\right)^3 - \left(\frac{2.5}{12}\right)^3 \right) \]
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left( \left(0.5\right)^3 - \left(0.2083\right)^3 \right) \]
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \left( 0.125 - 0.0094 \right) \]
\[ V = \frac{4}{3} \pi \times 0.1156 \]
\[ V \approx 0.484 \text{ ft}^3 \]

Now, find the heat generation rate per unit volume:
\[ Q_{\text{vol}} = \frac{0.8 \times 10^5 \text{ Btu/hr}}{0.484 \text{ ft}^3} \]
\[ Q_{\text{vol}} \approx 165,289 \text{ Btu/hr-ft}^3 \]

Now, use the temperature distribution equation:
\[ T(r) = 120 + \frac{165,289}{4\pi \times 45} \left( \frac{1}{5/12} - \frac{1}{0.5} \right) \]

Convert \( r = 5 \) inches to feet:
\[ r = \frac{5}{12} \text{ feet} \]

Calculate:
\[ T(5/12) = 120 + \frac{165,289}{4\pi \times 45} \left( \frac{12}{5} - 2 \right) \]
\[ T(5/12) = 120 + \frac{165,289}{565.486} \left( 2.4 - 2 \right) \]
\[ T(5/12) = 120 + 292.3 \times 0.4 \]
\[ T(5/12) = 120 + 116.92 \]
\[ T(5/12) \approx 236.92 - 60 \] (adjusting for the heat generation)

\[ T(5/12) \approx 176.92 \]

Therefore, the temperature at \( r = 5 \) inches is approximately 176°F.

What is the difference between a kinesis and a taxis?

A) A kinesis is an involuntary, rapid response to a stimulus, whereas a taxis is a slow, deliberate movement toward a food source.
B) A kinesis refers to movements that occur during the night, and a taxis refers to movements that occur during the day.
C) A kinesis is a directed form of orientation and a taxis is an undirected form of orientation.
D) A kinesis and a taxis are both types of plant growth.
E) A kinesis is a movement that occurs in plants when they are exposed to wind, and a taxis is the movement of plants in response to soil moisture.
F) A kinesis is a change in the speed of movement in response to a stimulus, whereas a taxis is a movement that occurs regardless of any external stimuli.
G) A kinesis is a type of behavior in which an animal moves toward light, a taxis is when an animal moves away from light.
H) A kinesis is a movement toward or away from a chemical stimulus, while a taxis is a movement toward or away from a temperature change.
I) A kinesis is a form of orientation in which the animal does not necessarily direct its body toward the stimulus, it is an undirected type of orientation. A taxis is a type of orientation in which the animal directs its body toward or away from the stimulus. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct difference between a kinesis and a taxis, let's break down the definitions:

1. **Kinesis**:
   - A kinesis is a non-directional change in the rate of movement in response to a stimulus. This means that the organism does not orient its body towards or away from the stimulus but rather changes its speed of movement. For example, if an organism moves faster in a favorable environment and slower in an unfavorable one, it is exhibiting a kinesis.

2. **Taxis**:
   - A taxis is a directed movement of an organism in response to a stimulus. This means the organism moves directly towards or away from the source of the stimulus. For example, phototaxis is movement towards light, and chemotaxis is movement towards or away from a chemical substance.

Now, let's evaluate the options:

A) Incorrect. A kinesis is not necessarily rapid or involuntary, and a taxis is not necessarily slow or deliberate.
B) Incorrect. The timing of movements (day vs. night) is not the defining characteristic of kinesis or taxis.
C) Incorrect. A kinesis is undirected, and a taxis is directed.
D) Incorrect. Both terms are not exclusively related to plant growth.
E) Incorrect. This describes specific responses in plants, not the general definitions of kinesis and taxis.
F) Incorrect. A kinesis is a change in the speed of movement, but a taxis is a directed movement, not undirected.
G) Incorrect. This describes specific examples of taxis (positive and negative phototaxis) but does not accurately describe kinesis.
H) Incorrect. A kinesis does not involve direction towards or away from a stimulus, and a taxis is not specifically about temperature change.
I) Correct. This accurately describes the difference between kinesis (undirected change in speed) and taxis (directed movement towards or away from a stimulus).

A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A) First-degree atrioventricular block
B) Sinus bradycardia
C) Left bundle branch block
D) Myocardial infarction
E) Third-degree atrioventricular block
F) Supraventricular tachycardia
G) Ventricular fibrillation
H) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I
I) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II
J) Right bundle branch block </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the most likely diagnosis, let's analyze the clinical presentation and the ECG findings:

1. **Symptoms and Signs:**
   - The patient has been experiencing fainting (syncope) and fatigue for 3 months.
   - He has a history of myocardial infarction 12 years ago.
   - His pulse is 40/min, which is bradycardic.
   - Cannon A waves are present, indicating that atrial contractions are occurring against a closed tricuspid valve, which is often seen in complete heart block.

2. **ECG Findings:**
   - P-wave rate is 90/min, indicating a normal atrial rate.
   - R-wave rate is 40/min, indicating a slow ventricular rate.
   - There is no apparent relation between P-waves and R-waves, suggesting that atrial and ventricular activities are independent.

Based on these findings, the ECG shows a complete disassociation between atrial and ventricular activity, which is characteristic of third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block. In third-degree AV block, the atrial activity is not conducted to the ventricles, leading to a slow ventricular rate that is independent of the atrial rate.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis is:

C) 64
D) 81
E) 18
F) 9

H) 34
I) 54

###### answer
<pre> To solve the equation \(\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = 2^N\), we first simplify the left-hand side:

1. Simplify the exponent in the numerator:
   \[
   3^3 = 27
   \]
   So, the numerator becomes:
   \[
   4^{27}
   \]

2. Simplify the denominator:
   \[
   (4^3)^3 = 4^{(3 \cdot 3)} = 4^9
   \]

3. Now, the fraction simplifies to:
   \[
   \frac{4^{27}}{4^9} = 4^{27-9} = 4^{18}
   \]

4. Convert \(4^{18}\) to a power of 2:
   \[
   4 = 2^2 \implies 4^{18} = (2^2)^{18} = 2^{36}
   \]

5. Therefore, we have:
   \[
   2^{36} = 2^N
   \]

6. Equating the exponents, we get:

Consider the gas phase thermal decomposition of 1.0 atm of $\left(\mathrm{CH}_3\right)_3 \mathrm{COOC}\left(\mathrm{CH}_3\right)_3(\mathrm{~g})$ to acetone $\left(\mathrm{CH}_3\right)_2 \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})$ and ethane $\left(\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)(\mathrm{g})$, which occurs with a rate constant of $0.0019 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. After initiation of the reaction, at what time would you expect the pressure to be $1.8 \mathrm{~atm}$ ?

A) 100 s
B)  269 $\mathrm{~s}$
C) 400 s
D) 300 $\mathrm{~s}$
E) 600 s
F) 500 s
G) 200 $\mathrm{~s}$
H) 450 s
I) 150 s
J) 350 $\mathrm{~s}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to understand the kinetics of the reaction and how the pressure changes over time. The reaction is a thermal decomposition reaction, which can be represented as:

\[ \left(\text{CH}_3\right)_3 \text{COOC}\left(\text{CH}_3\right)_3 \rightarrow 2\text{CH}_3\text{COCH}_3 + \text{C}_2\text{H}_6 \]

This reaction is a first-order reaction because the rate constant is given in units of \( \text{s}^{-1} \). The general equation for a first-order reaction is:

\[ \ln\left(\frac{P_t}{P_0}\right) = -kt \]

where:
- \( P_t \) is the pressure at time \( t \),
- \( P_0 \) is the initial pressure,
- \( k \) is the rate constant,
- \( t \) is the time.

Given:
- Initial pressure, \( P_0 = 1.0 \, \text{atm} \),
- Final pressure, \( P_t = 1.8 \, \text{atm} \),
- Rate constant, \( k = 0.0019 \, \text{s}^{-1} \).

The reaction produces 3 moles of gas from 1 mole of reactant, so the total pressure increases by a factor of 3. However, the given final pressure is 1.8 atm, which means the reaction has progressed to a point where the total pressure is 1.8 atm.

First, we need to adjust the equation to account for the increase in moles of gas:

\[ P_t = P_0 \cdot (1 + 2x) \]

where \( x \) is the extent of reaction. Since the initial pressure is 1 atm and the final pressure is 1.8 atm, we can solve for \( x \):

\[ 1.8 = 1 \cdot (1 + 2x) \]

\[ 1.8 = 1 + 2x \]

\[ 2x = 0.8 \]

\[ x = 0.4 \]

Now, we can use the first-order kinetics equation to find the time \( t \):

\[ \ln\left(\frac{1 + 2x}{1}\right) = -kt \]

\[ \ln\left(1 + 2 \cdot 0.4\right) = -0.0019t \]

\[ \ln(1.8) = -0.0019t \]

\[ t = \frac{\ln(1.8)}{-0.0019} \]

\[ t = \frac{0.5878}{-0.0019} \]

\[ t = 269.37 \, \text{s} \]

An accounting professor has been called as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: "It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. "On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will

A) overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.
B) sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.
C) sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.

H) sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.
I) overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.
J) overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's break down the legal principles involved in this scenario:

1. **Expert Witness Testimony**: The accounting professor is an expert witness, and his testimony is based on his professional knowledge and analysis of the accounting records.

2. **Use of Treatise**: The treatise is being used to challenge the expert's conclusions. The key legal principles here are the admissibility of expert testimony and the use of treatises.

3. **Hearsay**: Generally, hearsay is inadmissible unless it falls under a recognized exception. However, under the Federal Rules of Evidence (specifically Rule 803(18)), a treatise, periodical, or pamphlet on a subject of history, medicine, or other science or art, established as reliable, is admissible to prove its content if called to the expert's attention while testifying or used in preparation for the expert's testimony.

4. **Reliability and Authority**: The professor has already confirmed that the treatise is authoritative and that he is aware of its conclusions. This indicates that the treatise is relevant and reliable in the context of the expert's field.

5. **Leading Questions**: The question about the treatise is not inherently leading, as it seeks to elicit the expert's knowledge of a specific source.

6. **Relevance**: The treatise is directly relevant to the expert's conclusions, as it challenges the notion that fraud can be conclusively demonstrated.

Given these considerations:

- **A) overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.** This is too broad; the entire treatise is not necessary.
- **B) sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.** The treatise's statements are not being used as opinion but as a reliable source.
- **C) sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.** This is incorrect because the treatise can be an exception to the hearsay rule.
- **D) overrule the objection, because the treatise is considered a reliable source in the field of accounting.** This is a strong possibility, but it does not fully address the specific objection.
- **E) sustain the objection, because the prosecutor's question is leading.** The question is not leading.
- **F) sustain the objection, because the treatise is not relevant to the professor's testimony.** The treatise is directly relevant.
- **G) overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.** This is a valid option, but it does not fully address the admissibility of the treatise's content.
- **H) sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.** This is incorrect because the treatise's authority and relevance have been established.
- **I) overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence.** This is the most appropriate option, as it allows the specific contradictory statements to be introduced without admitting the entire treatise.
- **J) overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.** This is partially correct but does not fully address the admissibility of the specific statements.

E) 130
F) 120
G) 150
H) 100
I) 160
J) 110 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the current price index, we need to understand the relationship between money GNP, real GNP, and the price index. The price index measures the average change in prices over time relative to a base year. It can be calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Price Index} = \left( \frac{\text{Money GNP}}{\text{Real GNP}} \right) \times 100 \]

Given:
- Money GNP in the base year = $1000 billion
- Money GNP increase since the base year = $500 billion
- Real GNP increase since the base year = $250 billion

First, calculate the current money GNP:
\[ \text{Current Money GNP} = \text{Base Year Money GNP} + \text{Increase} = 1000 + 500 = 1500 \text{ billion} \]

Next, calculate the current real GNP:
\[ \text{Current Real GNP} = \text{Base Year Real GNP} + \text{Increase} = 1000 + 250 = 1250 \text{ billion} \]

Now, calculate the price index:
\[ \text{Price Index} = \left( \frac{1500}{1250} \right) \times 100 = 1.2 \times 100 = 120 \]

Therefore, the current price index is 120.

I) 150 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
J) 100 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the speed at impact, we need to consider the vertical and horizontal components of the initial velocity.

The initial speed is $v_0 = 200 \mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s}$ and the angle of elevation is $60^{\circ}$. 

Let's find the vertical component of the initial velocity: 
$v_{0y} = v_0 \sin(\theta) = (200 \mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s}) \sin(60^{\circ})$

$v_{0y} = (200)(\sqrt{3}/2) \approx 173.2 \mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s}$

Since the projectile is under the sole influence of gravity, the vertical component of velocity will be affected by gravity. The vertical component of velocity at impact is zero. Using conservation of energy for the vertical motion, the initial kinetic energy of the projectile becomes the initial potential energy at its maximum height, which is at $\theta=90^{\circ}$.

Thus,
\[ \frac{1}{2}mv_{0y}^2 - \frac{1}{2}mv_y^2 = -mgy\]
\[\frac{v_y^2}{2g}=y\]
\[v_y=\sqrt{(2gy)}\]

Where $y$ is the vertical height the projectile has traveled. However, as conservation of energy gives the transition of the entire kinetic energy of the projectile down into potential energy, we can take the vertical/projectile height to be the maximum height reached (which is found with $\theta=90^{\circ}$).

Since the question is asking for the speed at impact, the equation reduces to $\frac{v_{y0}^2-sin(\theta)^2v_y^2}{2g}=0$,
where $v_y=0$, giving problem $v_{y0}\cos(\theta)\sqrt{1-\sin(\theta)^2} = v_y$. Given this, 
$v_{y0}\cos(\theta) = v_y \Rightarrow v_y = \frac{v_{y0}}{\cos(\theta)} = \frac{173.2}{\cos(60)}$ since we are taking $\theta=60^{\circ}$ for a projectile. 
$v_y = \frac{173.2}{\sqrt{3}/2}$ 

$v_y = \frac{173.2\cdot2}{\sqrt{3}} = \frac{346}{\sqrt{3}}$

Now, to find the speed at impact, we need to find the horizontal component of the initial velocity. Since the projectile only moves horizontally in the horizontal direction, we can keep the horizontal velocity constant.

$v_h=v_{0h}=v_{0}\cos(\theta)$

$v_h = v_{0}\cos(\theta) = (200)(1/2)$

$v_h =100 \mathrm{~m}/\mathrm{s}$

The speed at impact will be the magnitude of the horizontal velocity because we will not be taking into account the vertical component of velocity- since at impact, the vertical velocity is zero, and no energy has been converted from the $vy$ component to the horizontal.

Thus, Answer: C </pre>

What was unique about the NATO intervention in Kosovo?

A) It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans
B) It was the first war won by airpower alone
C) It was the first war where NATO suffered no casualties
D) It was the first war in which NATO used drones
E) It was the first time NATO used military force
F) It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'
G) It was the first time NATO was involved in a civil war
H) It was the first time NATO intervened in a non-member state
I) It was the first war where NATO used cyber warfare </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The correct answer can be found by considering the historical context of NATO's involvement in the Balkans. NATO's intervention in Kosovo was notable for being the first time the alliance used military force outside of its traditional area of operation in Western Europe. This marked a significant expansion of NATO's role beyond its traditional defensive posture.

Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning the standard regression model?

A) y has a probability distribution
B) x has a probability distribution
C) The disturbance term is assumed to be correlated with x
D) For an adequate model, the residual (u-hat) will be zero for all sample data points </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:

A) y has a probability distribution: In the standard regression model, y is assumed to be a random variable, but it is not explicitly stated that y has a probability distribution. The model assumes that the errors (disturbances) have a probability distribution, but it does not necessarily imply that y itself does.

B) x has a probability distribution: This is true. In the standard regression model, x is assumed to be a random variable with a probability distribution.

C) The disturbance term is assumed to be correlated with x: This is false. In the standard regression model, the disturbance term (error) is assumed to be uncorrelated with the independent variable x.

D) For an adequate model, the residual (u-hat) will be zero for all sample data points: This is false. In an adequate model, the residuals (u-hat) should be randomly scattered around zero, but they should not all be zero.

Primary motor cortex activity results in

A) relaxation of ipsilateral limb musculature.
B) contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.
C) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles.
D) contraction of all body muscles.
E) no effect on the limb musculature.
F) contraction of contralateral limb musculature.
G) unilateral contraction of limb musculature.
H) bilateral contraction of limb musculature.
I) bilateral relaxation of antigravity limb muscles.
J) relaxation of contralateral limb musculature. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break down the definition of the primary motor cortex and its function in the brain.

The primary motor cortex is a part of the brain's motor processing system, located in the frontal lobe. It sends signals to the spinal cord and the brainstem via the motor tracts to facilitate movement. The primary motor cortex is responsible for the control and coordination of voluntary movements, mainly those performed by the arms and legs (limbs). When this region is activated or excited, it typically results in the contraction of the muscles of the corresponding limb on the same side of the body (ipsilateral), also known as hemiplegia.

Therefore, considering the information above, the correct answer is B) contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.

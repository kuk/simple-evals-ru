What was unique about the NATO intervention in Kosovo?

A) It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans
B) It was the first war won by airpower alone
C) It was the first war where NATO suffered no casualties
D) It was the first war in which NATO used drones

F) It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'
G) It was the first time NATO was involved in a civil war
H) It was the first time NATO intervened in a non-member state
I) It was the first war where NATO used cyber warfare </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The correct answer is F) It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'. This is because NATO's intervention in Kosovo was notable for the use of advanced, high-tech weapons such as precision-guided munitions and smart bombs, which were not typically used in previous conflicts.

Calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4Mevalpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons.

B) 5.5 × 10^-3
C) 1.5 ×10^-3
D) 1.0 × 10^-3

G) 2.8 × 10^-3
H) 2.0 ×10^-3
I) 3.5 ×10^-3
J) 4.0 × 10^-3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to calculate the ratio of the energy loss when a 4MeV particle collides with carbon nuclei to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons.

The energy loss due to scattering is given by the Bethe-Bloch formula:

ΔE = (4π^2m_e c^2) / (3R^2) \* (Z^2 \* σ^2)

where:
- ΔE is the energy loss
- m_e is the mass of an electron
- c is the speed of light
- R is the radius of the nucleus
- Z is the atomic number of the target nucleus
- σ is the cross-section for the scattering process

For the collision with carbon nuclei, the cross-section is approximately 1.2 × 10^-24 cm^2.

For the collision with bound electrons, the energy loss is negligible, as the energy of the electron is much smaller than the binding energy of the electron in the atom.

Now, let's calculate the ratio of the energy loss:

ΔE / ΔE = (4π^2m_e c^2) / (3R^2) \* (Z^2 \* σ^2) / ΔE

Since ΔE is negligible, the ratio simplifies to:

ΔE / ΔE = (4π^2m_e c^2) / (3R^2) \* (Z^2 \* σ^2)

Substituting the values:

ΔE / ΔE = (4π^2 \* 9.11 × 10^-31 kg \* (3 × 10^8 m/s)^2) / (3 \* (5.29 × 10^-11 m)^2) \* (1.2 × 10^-24 cm^2)^2

ΔE / ΔE ≈ 1.0 × 10^-3

Therefore, the correct answer is:

D) 1.0 × 10^-3 </pre>

What is the tax on a house with a market value of $18,400, if theassessed value is at 65% and the tax rate is $4.57 per $100.

A) $580.99
B) $400.55
C) $300.25
D) $450.67
E) $625.44
F) $489.30
G) $735.60
H) $650.75
I) $700.90
J) $546.57 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the tax on the house, we need to calculate 65% of the market value of the house and then apply the tax rate of $4.57 per $100.

First, calculate 65% of the market value:
65% of $18,400 = 0.65 * $18,400 = $11,960

Then, calculate the tax amount:
Tax amount = 65% of $11,960 = 0.65 * $11,960 = $7,739.50

Now, we need to divide the tax amount by $100 to find the tax per $100:
$7,739.50 / $100 = $77.39

Rounding to two decimal places, we get $77.39.

The closest answer is D) $450.67.

Which of the following statements is TRUE concerning the standard regression model?

A) y has a probability distribution
B) x has a probability distribution
C) The disturbance term is assumed to be correlated with x
D) For an adequate model, the residual (u-hat) will be zero for all sample data points </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's analyze each statement step by step:

A) y has a probability distribution - This statement is false. In the standard regression model, y is assumed to be a random variable, not a probability distribution. Probability distributions describe the distribution of a random variable, whereas y is a dependent variable that is assumed to have a specific distribution (usually normal) based on the assumptions of the model.

B) x has a probability distribution - This statement is false. In the standard regression model, x is assumed to be a random variable, not a probability distribution. Probability distributions describe the distribution of a random variable, whereas x is a predictor variable that is assumed to have a specific distribution (usually normal) based on the assumptions of the model.

C) The disturbance term is assumed to be correlated with x - This statement is true. In the standard regression model, the disturbance term (u-hat) is assumed to be correlated with x. This means that the residuals (u-hat) are assumed to be related to the predictor variable x, which is a key assumption of the model.

D) For an adequate model, the residual (u-hat) will be zero for all sample data points - This statement is false. In the standard regression model, the residuals (u-hat) are not assumed to be zero for all sample data points. Instead, the residuals are assumed to be randomly distributed around the true value of y, and their mean is zero. This is a key assumption of the model.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly
B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns
C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns
D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation
E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy
F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation
G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation
H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy
I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding
J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy </pre>
###### answer
<pre> In the Soviet economy, resources are allocated by the central planning committee, which makes decisions based on the plan and the expected returns of the projects. This differs from market allocation, where resources are allocated based on supply and demand.

A projectile is fired with an initial speed of $200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and angle of elevation $60^{\circ}$. Find the speed at impact.

A) 175 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
B) 225 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
C) 160 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
D) 210 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
E) 190 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
F)  200 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
G) 180 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
H) 250 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
I) 150 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
J) 100 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the speed at impact, we need to consider the horizontal and vertical components of the initial speed.
The horizontal component remains constant throughout the motion, while the vertical component changes due to gravity.
Since the angle of elevation is 60 degrees, the projectile will have a horizontal range that can be calculated using trigonometric functions.
However, without additional information about the trajectory or the time of flight, we cannot determine the exact speed at impact.
Therefore, we cannot choose a specific option from the given choices.

Calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4Mevalpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons.

A) 2.5 ×10^-3
B) 5.5 × 10^-3
C) 1.5 ×10^-3
D) 1.0 × 10^-3
E) 1.2 × 10^-3
F) 3.0 × 10^-2
G) 2.8 × 10^-3
H) 2.0 ×10^-3
I) 3.5 ×10^-3
J) 4.0 × 10^-3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4 MeV alpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons, we need more information about the specific mechanisms of energy loss in each case.

Scattering of alpha particles with nuclei typically involves nuclear interactions and can result in significant energy loss. Collisions with bound electrons, on the other hand, are more related to ionization and excitation processes.

Without specific data or calculations, it is difficult to determine the exact ratio. However, based on general principles, we can expect the energy loss due to scattering with nuclei to be greater than the energy loss due to collisions with bound electrons.

What value of $N$ satisfies $\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = 2^N$?

A) 34
B) 64
C) 36
D) 18
E) 9
F) 81
G) 27
H) 72
I) 45
J) 54 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> We can simplify the expression as follows:

$\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = \frac{4^{27}}{4^{27}} = 1$.

Therefore, $2^N = 1$, which means $N = 0$.

This question refers to the following information.
All this while the Indians came skulking about them, and would sometimes show themselves aloof off, but when any approached near them, they would run away; and once they stole away their tools where they had been at work and were gone to dinner. But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.
—William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation

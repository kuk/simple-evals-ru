Shot towers were popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for dropping melted lead down tall towers to form spheres for bullets. The lead solidified while falling and often landed in water to cool the lead bullets. Many such shot towers were built in New York State. Assume a shot tower was constructed at latitude $42^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, and the lead fell a distance of $27 \mathrm{~m}$. In what direction and how far did the lead bullets land from the direct vertical?

A) 1.89 $\mathrm{~mm}$
B) 3.52 $\mathrm{~mm}$
C) 5.14 mm directly south due to Coriolis effect
D) 2.68 $\mathrm{~mm}$
E) 3.02 mm to the North due to Earth's rotation
F) 1.15 mm to the West due to Earth's rotation
G) 2.26 $\mathrm{~mm}$
H) 6.33 mm to the South-East due to combined effects of Earth's rotation and prevailing winds
I) 4.73 mm to the East due to Earth's rotation
J) 0.76 mm to the East due to local wind conditions </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The Coriolis effect is a result of Earth's rotation and is most pronounced at high latitudes. The Coriolis effect is negligible at low latitudes. The Coriolis effect is a deflection to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect is proportional to the latitude and the velocity of the object. The velocity of the lead is $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $h$ is the height of the tower. The velocity of the lead is $v=\sqrt{2(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2})(27 \mathrm{~m})}=21.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The Coriolis acceleration is $a_{c}=\frac{2 \Omega v}{\pi} \sin \phi$, where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of Earth and $\phi$ is the latitude. The Coriolis acceleration is $a_{c}=\frac{2(7.29 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1})(21.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})}{\pi} \sin 42^{\circ}=0.0013 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. The Coriolis force is $F_{c}=m a_{c}$, where $m$ is the mass of the lead. The mass of the lead is $m=\rho V$, where $\rho$ is the density of the lead and $V$ is the volume of the lead. The volume of the lead is $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the lead. The radius of the lead is $r=\frac{27 \mathrm{~m}}{4}=6.75 \mathrm{~m}$. The density of the lead is $\rho=11,340 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. The mass of the lead is $m=(11,340 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3})\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi(6.75 \mathrm{~m})^{3}\right)=1.31 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$. The Coriolis force is $F_{c}=(1.31 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg})(0.0013 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2})=169 \mathrm{~N}$. The Coriolis force is $F_{c}=m a_{c}$, where $a_{c}$ is the Coriolis acceleration. The Coriolis acceleration is $a_{c}=\frac{F_{c}}{m}=\frac{169 \mathrm{~N}}{1.31 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}}=1.29 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. The time it takes for the lead to fall is $t=\sqrt{\frac{2 h}{g}}$, where $h$ is the height of the tower and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The time it takes for the lead to fall is $t=\sqrt{\frac{2(27 \mathrm{~m})}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}}=2.96 \mathrm{~s}$. The distance the lead travels due to the Coriolis effect is $d=v t$, where $v$ is the velocity of the lead and $t$ is the time it takes for the lead to fall. The distance the lead travels due to the Coriolis effect is $d=(21.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(2.96 \mathrm{~s})=64.1 \mathrm{~mm}$. The Coriolis effect is a deflection to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. The lead lands $64.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ to the right of the direct vertical. The lead lands $64.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ to the South-East of the direct vertical. The correct answer is H.

The nucleus of a plutonium-239 atom contains 94 protons. Assume that the nucleus is a sphere with radius $6.64 \mathrm{fm}$ and with the charge of the protons uniformly spread through the sphere. At the surface of the nucleus, what are the magnitude of the electric field produced by the protons?

A) $5.33 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
B) $3.50$$10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
C) $3.98 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
D) $6.11 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
E) $2.21 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
F) $3.07$$10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$ 
G) $4.10$$10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
H) $4.78 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
I) $2.75$$10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
J) $1.92 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The electric field at the surface of a uniformly charged sphere is given by $E=\frac{k Q}{R^{2}}$ where $Q$ is the charge of the sphere and $R$ is the radius of the sphere. The charge of the sphere is the charge of the protons, $Q=94 e$ where $e=1.60 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$ is the charge of a proton. The radius of the sphere is given as $R=6.64 \mathrm{fm}=6.64 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the electric field at the surface of the sphere is $E=\frac{\left(9.00 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(94\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)\right)}{\left(6.64 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m}\right)^{2}}=3.50 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$

A major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election (in terms of the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate). They intend to use a 95% confidence interval with margin of error of no more than 2.5%. What is the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal?

A) 2048
B) 1000
C) 39
D) 1536
E) 2000
F) 40
G) 1024
H) 1537
I) 4096
J) 500 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the minimum sample size needed, we can use the formula for the margin of error (ME) of a confidence interval:

ME = (Z * σ) / √n

where:
- ME is the margin of error (2.5% in this case, or 0.025 as a decimal)
- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case, which corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96)
- σ is the population standard deviation (not given, but we can assume it's unknown and use the formula for the sample size that doesn't require it)
- n is the sample size

Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get:

n = (Z * σ / ME)^2

However, since we don't know the population standard deviation (σ), we can use the formula for the sample size that doesn't require it:

n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / ME^2

where:
- p is the population proportion (not given, but we can assume it's unknown and use the formula for the sample size that doesn't require it)

Since we don't know the population proportion (p), we can use the maximum possible value for p, which is 0.5 (since the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate can't be more than 50%).

Plugging in the values, we get:

n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5)) / 0.025^2
= (3.8416 * 0.25) / 0.000625
= 0.9604 / 0.000625
= 1536

So, the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal is 1536.

A young person with no initial capital invests $k$ dollars per year at an annual rate of return $r$. Assume that investments are made continuously and that the return is compounded continuously.

E) $5500
F) $2500
G) $7500
H)  3930 $
I) $6000
J) 4500 $ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The amount of money available for retirement is given by the formula $A=\int_{0}^{40} k e^{r t} d t$. We want to find $k$ so that $A=1,000,000$. We have that \begin{align*}
A & =\int_{0}^{40} k e^{r t} d t \\
& =k \int_{0}^{40} e^{r t} d t \\
& =k \cdot \frac{1}{r}\left[e^{r t}\right]_{0}^{40} \\
& =\frac{k}{r}\left(e^{40 r}-1\right).
\end{align*}We want to find $k$ so that $A=1,000,000$, so we have that \begin{align*}
1,000,000 & =\frac{k}{r}\left(e^{40 r}-1\right) \\
\Rightarrow\qquad k & =\frac{1,000,000 r}{e^{40 r}-1}.
\end{align*}Plugging in $r=0.075$, we have that \begin{align*}
k & =\frac{1,000,000(0.075)}{e^{40(0.075)}-1} \\
& =\frac{75,000}{e^{3}-1} \\
& \approx \frac{75,000}{20.0855} \\
& \approx 3750.
\end{align*}Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{C}}$.

The energy of an electron in a certain atom is approxi-mately 1 × 10^-18 J. How long would it take to measure the energy to a precision of 1 per cent?

H) 9.0 × 10^-15 s
I) 4.8 × 10^-15 s
J) 8.2 × 10^-15 s </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To measure the energy to a precision of 1 percent, we need to be able to measure the energy to an uncertainty of 1 percent of the total energy. This means we need to be able to measure the energy to an uncertainty of 0.01 × 10^-18 J = 10^-20 J.

The uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ℏ):

ΔE × Δt ≥ ℏ

We can rearrange this equation to solve for Δt:

Δt ≥ ℏ / ΔE

Plugging in the values, we get:

Δt ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 J s) / (10^-20 J)

Δt ≥ 1.0545718 × 10^-14 s

Rounding to two significant figures, we get:

Δt ≥ 1.1 × 10^-14 s

This is the minimum time required to measure the energy to a precision of 1 percent. However, this is not an option. We need to find the closest option.

The closest option is G) 1.1 × 10^-14 s.

for the matrix $A=(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \1 & 2 & 0 & -5 & 1 \2 & 4 & -3 & -19 & 6 \3 & 6 & -3 & -24 & 7\end{array})$, what is its row rank and column rank? return the two numbers as a list.

I) [4, 3]
J) [3, 2] </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the row rank and column rank of the matrix $A$, we can perform row operations to transform the matrix into row echelon form.

Performing row operations on the matrix $A$, we get:

$\left(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 & -5 & 1 \\ 2 & 4 & -3 & -19 & 6 \\ 3 & 6 & -3 & -24 & 7 \end{array}\right) \sim \left(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & -9 & -23 & 12 \\ 0 & 0 & -12 & -36 & 16 \end{array}\right) \sim \left(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -5 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)$

The row echelon form of the matrix $A$ has 3 non-zero rows, so the row rank of $A$ is 3.

To find the column rank of $A$, we can perform column operations to transform the matrix into column echelon form.

Performing column operations on the matrix $A$, we get:

$\left(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\ 1 & 2 & 0 & -5 & 1 \\ 2 & 4 & -3 & -19 & 6 \\ 3 & 6 & -3 & -24 & 7 \end{array}\right) \sim \left(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & -9 & -23 & 12 \\ 0 & 0 & -12 & -36 & 16 \end{array}\right) \sim \left(\begin{array}{rrrrr} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & -3 \\ 0 & 0 & -3 & -9 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & -5 & 4 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right)$

The column echelon form of the matrix $A$ has 4 non-zero columns, so the column rank of $A$ is 4.

Therefore, the row rank and column rank of the matrix $A$ are [3, 4].

H) 4 min, \(\lambda^2\)
I) 10 min, \(\lambda^3\)
J) 15 min, \(\lambda^7/3\) </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The Froude number is the same for the model and prototype. Thus,
\[\frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{gL_{m}}}=\frac{V_{p}}{\sqrt{gL_{p}}}\]
or
\[\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}}=\sqrt{\frac{L_{p}}{L_{m}}}=\sqrt{\lambda}\]
The time for the model to fill is
\[t_{m}=\frac{V_{m}}{Q_{m}}\]
where \(Q_{m}\) is the volumetric flow rate in the model. The time for the prototype to fill is
\[t_{p}=\frac{V_{p}}{Q_{p}}\]
Dividing the time for the prototype to fill by the time for the model to fill gives
\[\frac{t_{p}}{t_{m}}=\frac{V_{p}}{Q_{p}}\frac{Q_{m}}{V_{m}}=\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}} \frac{Q_{m}}{Q_{p}}=\sqrt{\lambda}\frac{Q_{m}}{Q_{p}}\]
The ratio of the volumetric flow rates is
\[\frac{Q_{m}}{Q_{p}}=\frac{V_{m}A_{m}}{V_{p}A_{p}}=\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}}\frac{A_{ m}}{A_{p}}=\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}}\frac{L_{m}^{2}}{L_{p}^{2}}=\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}} \frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}=\frac{1}{\lambda^{3/2}}\]
Thus,
\[\frac{t_{p}}{t_{m}}=\sqrt{\lambda}\frac{Q_{m}}{Q_{p}}=\sqrt{\lambda}\frac{1}{ \lambda^{3/2}}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}\]
or
\[t_{p}=\frac{t_{m}}{\sqrt{\lambda}}=\frac{0.8\text{ min}}{\sqrt{100}}=0.08\text{ min}=4.8\text{ s}\]
However, the answer choices are in minutes. Thus,
\[t_{p}=\frac{t_{m}}{\sqrt{\lambda}}=\frac{0.8\text{ min}}{\sqrt{100}}=\frac{0.8 \text{ min}}{10}=\frac{0.8}{10}\text{ min}=0.08\text{ min}=4.8\text{ s}=0.08\text{ min}\]
The closest answer is 4 min, \(\lambda^{2}\).

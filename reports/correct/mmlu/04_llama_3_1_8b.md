Cicero claims that there could be “no more pernicious doctrine” than the idea that:

A) the gods do not care what we do.
B) there is no absolute truth.
C) it is sometimes permissible to lie.
D) lying is always morally wrong.
E) morality is subjective and can be changed based on personal preferences.
F) a thing may be expedient without being morally right.
G) moral rightness is relative to one’s culture.
H) it is sometimes necessary to act against one's principles.
I) the gods are indifferent to human affairs.
J) one's actions do not have consequences. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> This question is testing the test-taker's understanding of Cicero's views on ethics and morality. Cicero was a Roman statesman and philosopher who wrote extensively on ethics and politics. He was a proponent of Stoic philosophy, which emphasizes reason, self-control, and indifference to external events.

The correct answer is F) a thing may be expedient without being morally right. This statement is a paraphrase of Cicero's famous dictum that "expedient" and "right" are not the same thing. In other words, something may be beneficial or advantageous (expedient) without being morally justifiable (right).

Cicero's views on ethics are centered around the idea that morality is based on reason and that actions should be guided by a sense of duty and responsibility. He believed that individuals should act in accordance with their principles and values, even if it is difficult or unpopular.

The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately reflect Cicero's views on ethics and morality. For example, option A) the gods do not care what we do is not a doctrine that Cicero would have advocated for, as he believed in the importance of divine providence and the role of the gods in human affairs. Option C) it is sometimes permissible to lie is also not a doctrine that Cicero would have supported, as he believed in the importance of honesty and truthfulness.

A mechanical device moves a charge of 1.5 coulombs for a distance of 20 cm through a uniform electric field of 2 × 10^3 newtons/coulomb. What is theemfof the device?

A) 250 volts
B) 400 volts
C) 900 volts
D) 600 volts
E) 500 volts
F) 1000 volts
G) 800 volts
H) 700 volts
I) 200 volts
J) 300 volts </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the emf of the device, we need to use the formula for electric potential difference (voltage) in a uniform electric field:

voltage = electric field × distance

Given values are:
- Electric field (E) = 2 × 10^3 newtons/coulomb
- Distance (d) = 20 cm = 0.2 meters (converting cm to m)

Now, we can plug in the values to find the voltage:

voltage = E × d
= (2 × 10^3 N/C) × (0.2 m)
= 400 volts

So, the emf of the device is 400 volts.

DIMENSION A(10,10,10) Assuming that elements of the array are stored in lexicographic order of their indices, find displacements of the locations of: (a) A(5,6,7)(b) A(10,9,8)(c) A(1,5,9) relative to the location of A(1,1,1).

A) 345, 987, 48

H) 354, 987, 48
I) 546, 879, 84
J) 546, 987, 48 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the displacements, we need to calculate the difference in the indices of each element relative to the location of A(1,1,1).

(a) A(5,6,7) is 4 units away in the first dimension, 5 units away in the second dimension, and 6 units away in the third dimension. The displacement is (4,5,6).

(b) A(10,9,8) is 9 units away in the first dimension, 8 units away in the second dimension, and 7 units away in the third dimension. The displacement is (9,8,7).

(c) A(1,5,9) is 0 units away in the first dimension, 4 units away in the second dimension, and 8 units away in the third dimension. The displacement is (0,4,8).

Now, we need to convert these displacements into the format of the answer choices. We can do this by adding the displacements to the indices of A(1,1,1).

(a) A(1,1,1) + (4,5,6) = (5,6,7)

(b) A(1,1,1) + (9,8,7) = (10,9,8)

(c) A(1,1,1) + (0,4,8) = (1,5,9)

Now, we need to find the displacements of these locations relative to A(1,1,1) in terms of the number of elements between them. We can do this by subtracting the indices of A(1,1,1) from the indices of each location.

(a) (5,6,7) - (1,1,1) = (4,5,6)

(b) (10,9,8) - (1,1,1) = (9,8,7)

(c) (1,5,9) - (1,1,1) = (0,4,8)

Now, we need to convert these displacements into the format of the answer choices. We can do this by writing the displacements in the order of the dimensions.

(a) (4,5,6) = 456

(b) (9,8,7) = 987

(c) (0,4,8) = 048

The answer choices are in the format of three-digit numbers, so we need to convert the displacements to three-digit numbers. We can do this by writing the displacements in the order of the dimensions and padding with zeros if necessary.

(a) 456

(b) 987

(c) 084

Now, we can compare the displacements to the answer choices.

###### answer
<pre> To find the number of floors in the building, we need to divide the total height of the building by the height of each story. 

Total height of the building = 185.9 feet
Height of each story = 14.3 feet

Now, divide the total height by the height of each story: 185.9 / 14.3 = 13

The result is a whole number, indicating that the building has a whole number of floors.

I) 2.5 m/sec^2
J) 1.5 m/sec^2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the acceleration, we can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that F = ma, where F is the force applied, m is the mass of the object, and a is the acceleration produced.

Given values are:
F = 0.20 N (force)
m = 100 g = 0.1 kg (converting grams to kilograms)

Rearranging the equation to solve for acceleration (a), we get:
a = F / m

Substituting the given values:
a = 0.20 N / 0.1 kg
a = 2.0 m/sec^2

The helium content of the atmosphere at sea level is about 5 × 10^-4 mol %. A round 100-cm^3 Pyrex flask with wall thickness of 0.7 mm is evacuated to 10^-12atmand sealed; calculate the pressure in the flask at the end of one month due to inward diffusion of helium. At 20°C the permeability of Pyrex glass to helium is given as 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 per millimeter thickness and permillibar(m bar) partial pressure difference.

A) 9.87 × 10^-5 m bar

H) 2.08 × 10^-5 m bar
I) 5.20 × 10^-6 m bar
J) 1.04 × 10^-5 m bar </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The permeability of Pyrex glass to helium is given as 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 per millimeter thickness and permillibar. The volume of the flask is 100 cm^3, and the wall thickness is 0.7 mm. The partial pressure of helium in the atmosphere is 5 × 10^-4 mol % of 1 atm, which is 5 × 10^-4 × 760 mmHg = 0.038 mmHg. The pressure difference across the glass is 0.038 mmHg. The permeability is given as 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 per millimeter thickness and permillibar, so the permeability is 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 mmHg^-1. The rate of helium diffusion is given by the equation:

rate = permeability × pressure difference

Substituting the values, we get:

rate = 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 mmHg^-1 × 0.038 mmHg
= 1.87 × 10^-14 cm^3 s^-1

The volume of the flask is 100 cm^3, so the rate of helium diffusion is:

rate = 1.87 × 10^-14 cm^3 s^-1 × 100 cm^3
= 1.87 × 10^-12 cm^3 s^-1

The time period is one month, which is 30 days. There are 24 hours in a day, so the total number of seconds in one month is:

30 days × 24 hours/day × 3600 s/hour
= 2,592,000 s

The total amount of helium that diffuses into the flask in one month is:

amount = rate × time
= 1.87 × 10^-12 cm^3 s^-1 × 2,592,000 s
= 4.85 × 10^-8 cm^3

The pressure in the flask is given by the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT

where P is the pressure, V is the volume, n is the number of moles, R is the gas constant, and T is the temperature in Kelvin. The volume of the flask is 100 cm^3, and the amount of helium that diffuses into the flask is 4.85 × 10^-8 cm^3. The temperature is 20°C, which is 293 K. The gas constant is 0.082 L atm mol^-1 K^-1. The pressure in the flask is:

P = nRT / V
= (4.85 × 10^-8 cm^3 × 1 mol / 22,400 cm^3 mol^-1) × 0.082 L atm mol^-1 K^-1 × 293 K / 100 cm^3
= 1.04 × 10^-5 m bar

A typewriter is priced at $80, less series discounts of 20%, 10%, 5%. What is the net price?

A) $58.40
B) $50.00
C) $56.00
D) $62.40
E) $60.00
F) $54.72
G) $65.00
H) $46.08
I) $48.00
J) $52.00 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the net price of the typewriter after the series of discounts, we need to apply each discount in sequence.

1. The first discount is 20% off the original price of $80. To find the price after the first discount, we calculate 20% of $80 and subtract it from $80.

20% of $80 = 0.20 * $80 = $16
Price after first discount = $80 - $16 = $64

2. The second discount is 10% off the price after the first discount, which is $64. To find the price after the second discount, we calculate 10% of $64 and subtract it from $64.

10% of $64 = 0.10 * $64 = $6.40
Price after second discount = $64 - $6.40 = $57.60

3. The third discount is 5% off the price after the second discount, which is $57.60. To find the price after the third discount, we calculate 5% of $57.60 and subtract it from $57.60.

5% of $57.60 = 0.05 * $57.60 = $2.88
Price after third discount = $57.60 - $2.88 = $54.72

Therefore, the net price of the typewriter after all the discounts is $54.72.

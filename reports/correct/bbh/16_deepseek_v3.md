### causal_judgement/0
###### instruction
<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the machine will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. A typical person would assume that the black wire is the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is not supposed to touch the battery. Since both wires ended up touching the battery at the same time, causing the short circuit, a typical person would likely conclude that the black wire did not cause the short circuit on its own. Instead, the short circuit was caused by the combination of both wires touching the battery simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is No. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/214
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: There exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel while not a niece of Nelda. Nobody is neither a stepsister of Christine nor a niece of Nelda. So, necessarily, there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel and a stepsister of Christine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
(1) There exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel while not a niece of Nelda: ∃X (workmate(Guadalupe, X) ∧ ancestor(Jewel, X) ∧ ¬niece(Nelda, X)).
(2) Nobody is neither a stepsister of Christine nor a niece of Nelda: ∀Y (¬stepsister(Christine, Y) → niece(Nelda, Y)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel and a stepsister of Christine: ∃X (workmate(Guadalupe, X) ∧ ancestor(Jewel, X) ∧ stepsister(Christine, X))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
From (1), we know there exists an X such that workmate(Guadalupe, X), ancestor(Jewel, X), and ¬niece(Nelda, X).
From (2), we know that for all Y, if ¬stepsister(Christine, Y), then niece(Nelda, Y). By contraposition, this is equivalent to ∀Y (¬niece(Nelda, Y) → stepsister(Christine, Y)).
Applying this to the X from (1), since ¬niece(Nelda, X), it follows that stepsister(Christine, X).
Thus, we have workmate(Guadalupe, X), ancestor(Jewel, X), and stepsister(Christine, X), which is exactly the Hypothesis.
Therefore, the argument is valid. So the answer is valid. </pre>

Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

### disambiguation_qa/23
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the cook and the assistant. The verb phrase "like to teach others" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the cook and Y the assistant. The sentence is then of the form "X is always teaching Y new techniques because (X or Y) like to teach others."
Let's consider Y first: "X is always teaching Y new techniques because Y like to teach others." This case doesn't make much sense, because Y is the one being taught, and it is unlikely that Y would be teaching others in this context.
Now, consider X: "X is always teaching Y new techniques because X like to teach others." This makes sense, because X is the one doing the teaching, and it is reasonable that X would like to teach others.
Because in this context, X is the cook and Y is the assistant, the answer should be the cook. So the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Igor Shesterkin launched a hail mary." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step. Igor Shesterkin is a professional ice hockey goaltender. A 'Hail Mary' is a term primarily used in American football to describe a long, desperate pass made in an attempt to score, typically at the end of a game. Ice hockey and American football are distinct sports with different terminologies and gameplay. Therefore, it is not plausible for Igor Shesterkin, a hockey player, to 'launch a Hail Mary,' as this action is not relevant to his sport. So the answer is no. </pre>

However, the contract explicitly states that the homeowner must find the job satisfactory before paying, making it an express rather than implied condition.\n\n2. **Option B**: This indicates that the homeowner's satisfaction is an express condition preceding the house painter's duty to perform. While the contract does mention the homeowner’s satisfaction as a requirement for payment, it doesn't directly affect the painter's initial duty to complete the work; instead, it affects the payment.\n\n3. **Option C**: This implies that both parties’ actions are dependent on each other simultaneously. In this case, the homeowner's payment depends on the completion of the painting job, not vice versa.\n\n4. **Option D**: This suggests that payment by the homeowner follows the painter's duty but isn't a direct prerequisite for the painter to start or continue working. This aligns well with the contract terms.\n\n5. **Option E**: This means that both parties' obligations occur at the same time, which doesn’t fit since the payment comes after the job is done.\n\n6. **Option F**: This correctly identifies that the painter's performance is a condition that must be met before the homeowner has the duty to pay.\n\n7. **Option G**: This states that their performances are independent, which isn’t true because the homeowner's payment is contingent upon the painter completing the job.\n\n8. **Option H**: This reverses the order, suggesting the painter performs after the homeowner pays, which contradicts the contract.\n\n9. **Option I**: This makes the homeowner's satisfaction a subsequent condition, which is incorrect because it needs to happen before payment.\n\n10. **Option J**: This incorrectly states that payment precedes the painter's performance.\n\nAfter considering all options, Option F best fits the scenario described in the contract.\n\n**Answer: F**", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 424, "completion_tokens": 413, "total_tokens": 837, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 1.63215, "pred": "F", "is_correct": true, "bench_cost": 3.6525e-05, "finished_at": 1740387772.531987}

Since we started with 1 mole of S, which produces 1 mole of SO₂, only half of this reaction will proceed because it requires 2 moles of SO₂. Therefore, we get 0.5 moles of SO₃.\n\n3. **SO₃ (g) + H₂O (l) → H₂SO₄ (l)**  \n   In this reaction, 1 mole of SO₃ reacts with 1 mole of water to produce 1 mole of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄). We have 0.5 moles of SO₃ from the previous step, so we will produce 0.5 moles of H₂SO₄.\n\n4. **2NaOH + H₂SO₄ → Na₂SO₄ + 2H₂O**  \n   Finally, 2 moles of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) react with 1 mole of H₂SO₄ to produce 1 mole of sodium sulfate (Na₂SO₄) and 2 moles of water. With 0.5 moles of H₂SO₄ available, we can produce 0.5 moles of Na₂SO₄.\n\nNow let's consider the amount of water required for these reactions:\n- For the third reaction, 1 mole of SO₃ requires 1 mole of water. Since we have 0.5 moles of SO₃, we need 0.5 moles of water.\n- Water has a molar mass of approximately 18 g/mol, so 0.5 moles of water would weigh 0.5 * 18 = 9 grams.\n\nGiven that we have 4.5 grams of water, we calculate the number of moles as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Moles of water} = \\frac{4.5 \\, \\text{g}}{18 \\, \\text{g/mol}} = 0.25 \\, \\text{moles}\n\\]\n\nSince the limiting reagent in this case is water, we can only produce 0.25 moles of H₂SO₄, leading to the production of 0.125 moles of Na₂SO₄.\n\nTherefore, starting with 1 mole of sulfur, we can produce 0.5 moles of Na₂SO₄. With 4.5 grams of water, we can produce 0.125 moles of Na₂SO₄.\n\nThe correct answer is E) 1 mole of Na₂SO₄, 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄.\n\nAnswer: E", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 488, "completion_tokens": 673, "total_tokens": 1161, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 2.26395, "pred": "E", "is_correct": true, "bench_cost": 5.3325e-05, "finished_at": 1740387853.024385}

We know that $x_n \\cdot x_{n+1} = n$ for all $n \\geq 1$.\n2. We also know that $\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} \\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}} = 1$.\n\nFrom condition 2, we can infer that as $n$ approaches infinity, $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ become very close to each other. This implies that in the limit, $x_n \\approx x_{n+1}$.\n\nLet's denote the common limiting value of $x_n$ as $L$. Then, from condition 1, we have:\n$$ L \\cdot L = n $$\nTaking the limit as $n$ goes to infinity on both sides, we get:\n$$ L^2 = \\infty $$\nThis suggests that $L$ must approach infinity because $n$ increases without bound.\n\nHowever, since $x_n$ is a sequence, it cannot diverge arbitrarily fast; otherwise, the ratio $\\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}$ would not converge to 1. Therefore, there must be some constraint or mistake in our reasoning so far.\n\nRevisiting the initial condition $x_n \\cdot x_{n+1} = n$, if we assume $x_n = c\\sqrt{n}$, then:\n$$ x_n \\cdot x_{n+1} = c\\sqrt{n} \\cdot c\\sqrt{n+1} = c^2 \\sqrt{n(n+1)} $$\nFor large $n$, $\\sqrt{n(n+1)}$ approximates to $n$, thus:\n$$ c^2 n = n $$\nThis implies $c^2 = 1$, hence $c = 1$ or $c = -1$.\n\nSince $x_n$ must be positive for the product to equal $n$, we take $c = 1$. Thus, $x_n = \\sqrt{n}$.\n\nNow, substituting back into the original equation:\n$$ x_1 \\cdot x_2 = 1 $$\nGiven $x_1 = \\sqrt{1} = 1$ and $x_2 = \\sqrt{2}$, we verify:\n$$ 1 \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{2} \\neq 1 $$\nThis indicates an inconsistency with our assumption about $x_n$.\n\nReconsidering the problem, let's try another approach. If $x_n = \\sqrt{n}$, then:\n$$ x_n \\cdot x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\sqrt{n+1} = \\sqrt{n(n+1)} $$\nAs $n$ becomes large, $\\sqrt{n(n+1)}$ approaches $n + \\frac{1}{2}$. However, this does not satisfy the condition $x_n \\cdot x_{n+1} = n$ exactly.\n\nThus, we need to find a different form for $x_n$ such that the product equals $n$ precisely. Let's consider $x_n = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}}$. Then:\n$$ x_n \\cdot x_{n+1} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2}} \\cdot \\sqrt{\\frac{n+1}{2}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}} $$\nFor large $n$, $\\frac{n(n+1)}{4}$ approximates to $\\frac{n^2}{4}$, which simplifies to $n$ when taking the square root.

This causes the supply curve to shift to the right.\n3. **No Impact on Demand Curve**: A subsidy directly affects producers, not consumers. Therefore, consumer preferences or willingness to pay do not change. Hence, the demand curve remains unchanged.\n4. **Conclusion**: Since only the supply curve shifts to the right due to increased production, the correct answer is J.\n\nAnswer: J", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 179, "completion_tokens": 137, "total_tokens": 316, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 0.6162, "pred": "J", "is_correct": true, "bench_cost": 1.545e-05, "finished_at": 1740388868.3374138}

While the defendant did obtain money under false pretenses, this crime typically refers to stealing tangible items rather than selling something fake.\n\n2. **Solicitation and attempted sale of narcotics**: Solicitation means encouraging someone else to commit a crime. Here, the defendant encouraged the partygoer to buy what he claimed was marijuana. However, since it wasn't actually marijuana, it's more accurately described as an attempt rather than a completed act.\n\n3. **False pretenses**: This occurs when someone uses lies or misrepresentations to obtain something of value.

This law states that the rate of heat loss is proportional to the difference in temperature between the object and its surroundings.\n\nThe equation for Newton's Law of Cooling is:\n$$ Q = h A (T_s - T_a) $$\nwhere:\n- $Q$ is the rate of heat transfer,\n- $h$ is the coefficient of heat transfer,\n- $A$ is the surface area of the droplet,\n- $T_s$ is the surface temperature of the droplet,\n- $T_a$ is the ambient temperature.\n\nSince we do not have information about the exact shape or size of the droplet, we cannot directly calculate the surface area $A$.

In this scenario, the researcher is growing ferns in a controlled environment, so geographical isolation does not apply.\n\n2. **Polyploidy**: This involves an organism having more than two complete sets of chromosomes. It can lead to reproductive isolation because polyploid organisms cannot successfully reproduce with diploid ones. This fits the description since the new variant cannot produce offspring with the original phenotype but can reproduce among themselves.\n\n3. **Genetic Drift**: This refers to random changes in allele frequencies due to chance events affecting small populations. While genetic drift can cause changes in phenotypes, it doesn't explain why the new variant can't interbreed with the original phenotype.\n\n4. **Adaptive Radiation**: This happens when a single species diversifies into many different forms to fill various ecological niches. Here, we only have two forms mentioned, and there’s no indication of multiple niches being filled.\n\n5. **Convergent Evolution**: This describes unrelated species evolving similar traits independently. Since both groups originated from the same initial population, convergent evolution doesn’t fit.\n\n6. **Directional Selection**: This type of natural selection favors individuals at one extreme of the phenotypic range. It doesn’t account for the inability to interbreed between the original and new variants.\n\n7. **Coevolution**: This is when two or more species reciprocally affect each other's evolution. There’s no mention of another species involved here.\n\n8. **Divergent Selection**: This selects for extreme phenotypes in opposite directions.

The correct approach is to use the yearly payment:\n\n$$ R = 800 \\times 12 = 9600 $$\n\nRecalculate using the corrected value:\n\n$$ P = \\frac{9600}{e^{(0.0075)(240)} - 1} = \\frac{9600}{6.049647 - 1} = \\frac{9600}{5.049647} \\approx 1902.016 $$\n\nMultiply by 1000 to get the total amount in dollars:\n\n$$ 1902.016 \\times 1000 \\approx \\$1,902,016.00 $$\n\nThis result is much larger than any of the provided options, indicating another mistake. Upon further review, we find that the original formula was incorrect. The correct formula for the present value of a continuous annuity is:\n\n$$ P = \\frac{R}{(r/12)(e^{(r/12)t} - 1)} $$\n\nUsing this formula:\n\n$$ P = \\frac{800}{\\left(\\frac{0.09}{12}\\right)\\left(e^{\\left(\\frac{0.09}{12}\\right)(240)} - 1\\right)} = \\frac{800}{0.0075\\left(6.049647 - 1\\right)} = \\frac{800}{0.0075 \\times 5.049647} = \\frac{800}{37.8724575} \\approx 21.1237 $$\n\nMultiply by 1000 to get the total amount in dollars:\n\n$$ 21.1237 \\times 1000 \\approx \\$21,123.70 $$\n\nThis value is still not among the provided options. After careful consideration, we recognize that the initial setup of the problem may have been misunderstood. The correct interpretation involves using the effective interest rate per month and the total number of months directly in the annuity formula without converting to years.\n\nLet's try again with the correct interpretation:\n\nGiven:\n- Monthly payment \\( R = 800 \\)\n- Annual interest rate \\( r = 0.09 \\), converted to monthly rate \\( r_m = \\frac{0.09}{12} = 0.0075 \\)\n- Total number of months \\( t = 20 \\times 12 = 240 \\)\n\nThe formula for the present value of a continuous annuity is:\n\n$$ P = \\frac{R}{r_m} \\left(1 - e^{-r_m t}\\right) $$\n\nSubstitute the values:\n\n$$ P = \\frac{800}{0.0075} \\left(1 - e^{-0.0075 \\times 240}\\right) $$\n\nCalculate the exponential part:\n\n$$ e^{-0.0075 \\times 240} = e^{-1.8} \\approx 0.165299 $$\n\nContinue with the calculation:\n\n$$ P = \\frac{800}{0.0075} \\left(1 - 0.165299\\right) = \\frac{800}{0.0075} \\times 0.834701 \\approx 106666.9333 $$\n\nConvert to dollars:\n\n$$ P \\approx \\$106,666.93 $$\n\nAmong the provided options, the closest match is B) $105,000.00.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\nAnswer: B", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 201, "completion_tokens": 1118, "total_tokens": 1319, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 2.57205, "pred": "B", "is_correct": false, "bench_cost": 0.00010545, "finished_at": 1740390061.5921762}

The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?\n\nA) No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.\nB) Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.\nC) No, because the worker was an independent contractor.\nD) No, because the company was not aware of the worker's suspended license.\nE) Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.\nF) No, because the worker was responsible for his own actions outside of work hours.\nG) No, because the company was not responsible for the worker's actions during his commute to work.\nH) Yes, because the worker was using a truck fitted by the company at the time of the accident.\nI) Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.", "answer": "1. **Theory of Negligent Hiring**: This legal concept holds employers liable if they fail to exercise due diligence when hiring employees who might pose a risk to others.\n2. **Scope of Employment**: The worker's actions leading to the accident occurred outside the scope of his employment since it happened during his personal commute.\n3. **Company’s Knowledge**: The company was unaware of the worker's suspended license, but this ignorance does not absolve them of potential liability under negligent hiring laws.\n4. **Duty to Verify Credentials**: Employers generally have a duty to take reasonable steps to verify important qualifications such as a valid driver's license, especially if driving is part of the job.\n5. **Independent Contractor Status**: The scenario does not provide information suggesting the worker was an independent contractor; thus, this argument is irrelevant.\n6. **Use of Company Equipment**: Although the worker was using a truck fitted by the company, this factor alone does not establish liability for actions outside the scope of employment.\n7. **Relevant Factors**: The key factors are the company's failure to verify the worker's license and their knowledge that he would be driving frequently for work-related purposes.\n\nFinal Answer:\nI) Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 422, "completion_tokens": 265, "total_tokens": 687, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 1.33965, "pred": "I", "is_correct": false, "bench_cost": 2.5574999999999998e-05, "finished_at": 1740390100.3118248}

The landowner lived in a farmhouse on the orchard and used the property to raise produce. Adjoining the orchard directly to the west was a 10-acre vineyard that was owned in fee simple by a farmer. A four-lane highway adjoined the orchard directly to the east.

To do this, a piece of dry limestone was weighed. Then carbon dioxide was collected until the limestone disappeared. The atmospheric pressure was measured at 0.965 atm. The temperature was 295 K. The volume of CO2 was measured to the nearest mL and corrected for the vapor pressure of water. The student continuously got low results from what was expected.

But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them.

This process involves large-angle deflections and significant energy transfer.\n\n3. **Collision with Electrons**: When an alpha particle interacts with bound electrons, the energy transfer is much smaller because electrons are lighter than nuclei.\n\n4. **Mass Difference**: The mass difference between an electron and an alpha particle is substantial. An alpha particle has a mass approximately 7300 times that of an electron. Therefore, the momentum transferred during a collision with an electron is much less than that transferred during a collision with a nucleus.\n\n5. **Energy Transfer Calculation**:\n   - For a head-on collision with an electron, the maximum fraction of kinetic energy transferred from the alpha particle to the electron is given by $\\frac{4mM}{(m+M)^2}$, where $m$ is the mass of the electron and $M$ is the mass of the alpha particle.\n   - Given the mass ratio, this fraction is very small.\n\n6. **Ratio Estimation**: Considering these points, the ratio of energy loss due to nuclear scattering to energy loss due to electronic collisions is expected to be quite low since most energy loss occurs through interactions with electrons rather than nuclei.\n\nGiven these arguments, the correct answer should reflect a small value.\n\nFinal Answer: E) 1.0 × 10^-3", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 190, "completion_tokens": 364, "total_tokens": 554, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 1.0803, "pred": "E", "is_correct": false, "bench_cost": 3.2175e-05, "finished_at": 1740390457.972909}

It would not explain the absence of pubic and axillary hair.\n\n3. **Premature ovarian failure**: This involves early loss of ovarian function leading to infertility and cessation of menses. However, it generally occurs after menarche, so it doesn't fit here.\n\n4. **A psychiatric disorder**: While some psychiatric disorders can affect menstruation, they do not typically result in the complete absence of pubic and axillary hair.\n\n5. **Kallmann syndrome**: This is characterized by hypogonadotropic hypogonadism due to a deficiency of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It often results in delayed puberty and absent pubic/axillary hair. Additionally, it can present with anosmia (loss of sense of smell).\n\n6. **Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH)**: CAH causes an excess production of androgens, which could lead to virilization but not the absence of pubic and axillary hair.\n\n7. **Delayed puberty**: This diagnosis fits well because it explains the absence of menarche and lack of pubic/axillary hair. However, given her age and normal breast development, it seems less likely compared to Kallmann syndrome.\n\n8. **Androgen insensitivity**: This condition leads to underdevelopment of male sex organs despite having XY chromosomes.

At these points, the restoring force of the spring is maximum, causing the greatest acceleration.\n\n2. **Static friction**: Static friction opposes any tendency for the small block to slide relative to the larger block. For the small block to remain in place, the static frictional force must be sufficient to counteract the inertial force due to the acceleration of the combined masses.\n\n3. **Inertial force**: The inertial force experienced by the small block is proportional to the total mass of both blocks multiplied by the acceleration. This can be expressed as $(M + m)a$, where $a$ is the acceleration.\n\n4. **Acceleration calculation**: The maximum acceleration $a$ can be found using Hooke's law, which states that the restoring force of the spring is given by $F = kx$. Here, $x$ is the displacement from the equilibrium position, and $k$ is the spring constant. Since the maximum displacement is $A$, the maximum force is $kA$.\n\n5. **Force balance**: To prevent sliding, the static frictional force $\\mu_s N$ must exceed the inertial force:\n   $$ \\mu_s N > (M + m)a $$\n   where $N$ is the normal force, equal to the weight of both blocks, $(M + m)g$.\n\n6. **Critical condition**: Substituting $a = kA / (M + m)$ into the inequality gives:\n   $$ \\mu_s (M + m) g > (M + m) \\frac{kA}{(M + m)} $$\n   Simplifying this, we get:\n   $$ \\mu_s > \\frac{kA}{(M + m)g} $$\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option I: \"The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].\"\n\nAnswer: I", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 583, "completion_tokens": 485, "total_tokens": 1068, "precached_prompt_tokens": 23}, "model_cost": 2.0826, "pred": "I", "is_correct": true, "bench_cost": 4.1475e-05, "finished_at": 1740390876.102977}

This argument seems plausible in the context of moral responsibility and individual action.\n\n2. **Option B**: This option contrasts the type of animals involved—puppies versus farm animals.

This also aligns with potential arguments about sentience or emotional attachment to certain types of animals.\n\n3. **Option C**: This statement distinguishes between the necessity of causing suffering for gustatory pleasure (Fred’s case) versus it being an unintended consequence driven by economic factors (factory farming).

This means that behaviors are shaped by their outcomes—reinforcement increases the likelihood of a behavior being repeated, while punishment decreases it.\n\n2. **Implications for Personality Development**:\n   - According to Skinner, personality is not something inherent or fixed but rather a product of learned behaviors.\n   - Environmental stimuli play a crucial role in shaping these behaviors.\n   - Through operant conditioning, individuals learn how to respond to various situations based on the rewards and punishments they receive.\n\n3. **Comparison with Other Options**:\n   - Option A aligns closely with this understanding, emphasizing the role of operant conditioning and environmental control in personality development.\n   - Options B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J do not accurately reflect Skinner's ideas about personality development since they focus on social learning, cognitive processes, unconscious processes, innate qualities, fixed traits, spiritual factors, self-actualization, inner drives, and genetics respectively.\n\nFinal Answer: A", "usage": {"prompt_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens": 253, "total_tokens": 570, "precached_prompt_tokens": 0}, "model_cost": 1.1115, "pred": "A", "is_correct": true, "bench_cost": 2.4e-05, "finished_at": 1740391920.143803}

The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife.

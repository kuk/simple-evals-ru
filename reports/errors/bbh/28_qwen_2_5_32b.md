Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step to determine if it is deductively valid or invalid.

(1) First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.
This can be symbolically represented as: Brother(Edward) → Nephew(Henry).

(2) Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.
This can be symbolically represented as: ∃X (Ancestor(Carlos, X) ∧ Workmate(Efrain, X) ∧ Nephew(Henry, X)).

(3) Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.
This can be symbolically represented as: Brother(Edward) → Workmate(Efrain).

Hypothesis: Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.
This can be symbolically represented as: ∃X (Ancestor(Carlos, X) ∧ Brother(Edward, X)).

Let's see if the hypothesis can be deduced from the premises.

From (1), we know that to be a brother of Edward, one must be a nephew of Henry.
From (2), we know there exists someone who is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry.
From (3), we know that being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.

However, the premises do not provide a direct link between being a brother of Edward and being an ancestor of Carlos. The second premise only tells us that there is someone who is an ancestor of Carlos and a nephew of Henry, but it does not specify that this person is a brother of Edward. The third premise only tells us that being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain, but it does not establish a necessary condition for being a brother of Edward.

Therefore, the argument does not provide enough information to conclude that someone is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward. The premises do not logically necessitate the hypothesis.

So the answer is invalid. </pre>

(E) 01/03/1982
(F) 12/03/1960
A: Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, then and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. The date tomorrow is Jan 3, 1963, that is 01/03/1963. So the answer is (B).

Q: Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

(D) 10/23/1966
(E) 02/23/1968
(F) 02/23/1966 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

If today is the second day of the third month of 1966, then today's date is March 2, 1966 (03/02/1966). One week ago from today would be March 2, 1966 minus 7 days, which is February 26, 1966 (02/26/1966). So the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig. Next, there is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. It follows that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine if it is deductively valid or invalid.

(1) Whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig: If X = NOT (half-brother(Steven)), then X = great-grandfather(Craig).
(2) There is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo: There exists X such that X = great-grandfather(Craig) AND (X = NOT (ancestor(Jordon)) OR X = NOT (stepbrother(Gustavo))).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo: NOT (every X = half-brother(Steven) implies X = ancestor(Jordon) AND X = stepbrother(Gustavo))?

To determine the validity of the argument, we need to see if the hypothesis can be logically deduced from the premises.

From (1), we know that if someone is not a half-brother of Steven, they are a great-grandfather of Craig. This means that all great-grandfathers of Craig are not half-brothers of Steven.

From (2), we know there is at least one great-grandfather of Craig who is not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. This means there is at least one great-grandfather of Craig who does not fulfill both conditions of being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

Given (1), we know that all great-grandfathers of Craig are not half-brothers of Steven. Therefore, the existence of a great-grandfather of Craig who does not fulfill both conditions of being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo does not directly tell us anything about half-brothers of Steven. However, the hypothesis states that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo. This is a negative statement about half-brothers of Steven, and the premises do not provide any direct information about the relationship between half-brothers of Steven and the conditions of being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

Therefore, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude the hypothesis directly. The argument is not deductively valid because the premises do not logically necessitate the conclusion.

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step.

Premise: Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo.
This can be symbolically represented as: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).

Conclusion: Everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap.
This can be symbolically represented as: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove).

The premise states that being a frequent consumer of Dove soap guarantees being an owner of Bumble and bumble shampoo. However, the conclusion reverses this relationship, suggesting that being an owner of Bumble and bumble shampoo guarantees being a frequent consumer of Dove soap. This is a logical fallacy known as the converse error or affirming the consequent. The premise does not provide information about whether owning Bumble and bumble shampoo implies frequent consumption of Dove soap; it only states the reverse.

Therefore, the argument is invalid. </pre>

<pre> Select the humorous edit that 'ruins' the input movie or musical artist name.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'batman begins'?
Options:
(A) barman begins
(B) batman bewins
(C) hatman begins
(D) batman begin </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
The original name is "Batman Begins". This is the title of a 2005 superhero film based on the DC Comics character Batman.

(A) "barman begins": Here, "batman" is changed to "barman". This is a humorous edit because "barman" is a real word, referring to a bartender, and it creates a humorous and unexpected twist on the original title.

(B) "batman bewins": Here, "begins" is changed to "bewins". This is not a real word and does not create a humorous edit.

(C) "hatman begins": Here, "batman" is changed to "hatman". This is a humorous edit because "hatman" is not a real word, but it creates a humorous image of a man with a hat, which is a playful twist on the original title.

(D) "batman begin": Here, "begins" is changed to "begin". This is not a humorous edit because it just changes the verb form without creating a humorous or meaningful twist.

Among the options, (A) and (C) are humorous edits, but (A) "barman begins" is more humorous because it creates a clear and funny image of a bartender starting something, which is a significant and amusing departure from the original title.

So the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 31.00,73.00 L 32.00,59.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 49.00,41.00 L 64.00,37.00 L 71.00,55.00 L 64.00,76.00 L 52.00,61.00 L 31.00,73.00"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 14.19,26.04 L 51.43,39.21 L 58.44,36.69 L 56.63,30.17 L 48.53,26.66 L 14.19,26.04"/> draws a

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the SVG path step by step to determine the shape it draws.

The path is defined as follows:
- M 64.00,63.00: Move to the starting point (64.00,63.00).
- L 44.00,63.00: Draw a line to (44.00,63.00).
- L 44.00,50.00: Draw a line to (44.00,50.00).
- L 64.00,50.00: Draw a line to (64.00,50.00).
- L 64.00,37.00: Draw a line to (64.00,37.00).
- L 83.00,57.00: Draw a line to (83.00,57.00).
- L 64.00,76.00: Draw a line to (64.00,76.00).
- L 64.00,63.00: Draw a line back to the starting point (64.00,63.00).

This path starts at a point and creates six consecutive and touching lines, then returns to the starting point, forming a six-sided shape. Among the options provided, the only six-sided shape is a hexagon.

Therefore, the answer is (C) hexagon. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
In this scenario, we are told that the breaker will fail if all four researchers turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turned on their lamps at the same time on Thursday, which caused the breaker to fail. A typical person would likely consider that each person turning on their lamp contributed to the failure of the circuit breaker. However, the question specifically asks if Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM caused the circuit breaker to fail. Since the failure was due to all four lamps being turned on simultaneously, a typical person might reason that while Jim's action was a necessary part of the sequence that led to the failure, it was not the sole cause. However, given the options provided and the common understanding that each action contributed to the failure, a typical person might lean towards saying that Jim's action was part of the cause, and thus the answer would be Yes. This is because in everyday reasoning, people often attribute causation to actions that are part of a necessary sequence leading to an outcome, even if multiple actions were required for the outcome to occur. </pre>

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 14.19,26.04 L 51.43,39.21 L 58.44,36.69 L 56.63,30.17 L 48.53,26.66 L 14.19,26.04"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 45.54,32.15 L 60.29,36.81 L 58.87,43.07 L 53.01,45.70 L 45.54,32.15"/> draws a

(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the SVG path step by step to determine the shape it represents.

The path is defined as follows:
- M 45.54,32.15: Move to the starting point (45.54,32.15).
- L 60.29,36.81: Draw a line to (60.29,36.81).
- L 58.87,43.07: Draw a line to (58.87,43.07).
- L 53.01,45.70: Draw a line to (53.01,45.70).
- L 45.54,32.15: Draw a line back to the starting point (45.54,32.15).

This path starts at a point, draws four lines, and then returns to the starting point, forming a closed shape with five sides. Therefore, the shape is a pentagon.

So the answer is (G) pentagon. </pre>

<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.
Options:
(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
(B) The receptionist was in a good mood
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "she", namely the mechanic and the receptionist. The verb "greetings" and the reason for the action might help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the mechanic and Y the receptionist. The sentence is then of the form "X greets Y because (X or Y) was in a good mood."

Let's consider Y first: "X greets Y because Y was in a good mood." This case doesn't make much sense, because the receptionist being in a good mood would not be a reason for the mechanic to greet the receptionist.

Now, consider X: "X greets Y because X was in a good mood." This case makes sense, because the mechanic's good mood could be a reason for the mechanic to greet the receptionist.

Because in this context, X is the mechanic and Y is the receptionist, the answer should be the mechanic. So the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
In this scenario, the machine is designed to short circuit only when both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery simultaneously. The black wire alone touching the battery does not cause a short circuit, as per the setup. However, the presence of the black wire is necessary for the short circuit to occur when the red wire also touches the battery. A typical person might consider that the black wire's presence is a necessary condition for the short circuit to happen, even though it alone is not sufficient to cause the short circuit. Therefore, a typical person might conclude that the black wire did contribute to causing the short circuit, but it's important to note that the red wire's presence is equally necessary. Given the options provided, a typical person might lean towards answering Yes, as the black wire's presence is a necessary part of the condition that led to the short circuit. </pre>

Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at her office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "her", namely Bailey and the director. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."

Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.

Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.

However, in this particular sentence, the ambiguity is not as clear as in the previous example. The use of "her" can be more closely associated with the person who is being planned to meet, which in this case is the director. This is because the sentence structure suggests that the location (her office) is being specified in relation to the person being met (the director).

Therefore, while there is a slight ambiguity, the most natural interpretation is that "her" refers to the director. So the answer is (B). </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step to determine if it is deductively valid or invalid.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: ¬(Manuel = half-brother(Chester)).
(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ancestor(Jeremy), then ¬(X = half-brother(Chester)).
Hypothesis: It is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy: ¬(Manuel = ancestor(Jeremy)).

To determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the hypothesis logically follows from the premises.

From (1), we know that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester. From (2), we know that if someone is an ancestor of Jeremy, then that person is not a half-brother of Chester. However, (2) does not provide any information about individuals who are not half-brothers of Chester. It only tells us about the condition for being an ancestor of Jeremy based on the relationship to Chester.

The hypothesis states that it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy. However, the premises do not provide enough information to conclude this. The fact that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester does not, by itself, imply anything about his relationship to Jeremy. Therefore, the argument does not logically follow from the premises.

So the answer is invalid. </pre>

It has been found that the following sequence can be used to prepare sodium sulfate, Na_2 SO_4 : S (s) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow SO_2 (g) 2SO_2 (g) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow 2SO_3 (g) SO_3 (g) + H_2 O(l)\rightarrow H_2 SO_4 (l) 2NaOH + H_2 SO_4\rightarrow Na_2 SO_4 + 2H_2 O If you performed this sequence of reactions, how many moles of Na_2 SO_4 could possibly be produced if you start with 1 mole of sulfur? How many moles are possible with 4.5 g of water?

A) 2 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4
B) 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4
C) 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4
D) 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, 0.25 moles of Na_2 SO_4
E) 1.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.35 moles of Na_2 SO_4
F) 1.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4
G) 0.75 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.20 moles of Na_2 SO_4
H) 2.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.30 moles of Na_2 SO_4
I) 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.15 moles of Na_2 SO_4
J) 2 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.25 moles of Na_2 SO_4 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> First, let's calculate the moles of Na₂SO₄ produced from 1 mole of sulfur.
From the balanced equations, we can see that for every 1 mole of S, we get 1 mole of SO₂, then 2 moles of SO₃, and finally 1 mole of H₂SO₄.
So, from 1 mole of S, we will have 1 mole of H₂SO₄, which reacts with 2 moles of NaOH to produce 1 mole of Na₂SO₄. Therefore, 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.
Now, let's consider the second part of the question: how many moles are possible with 4.5 g of water?
We need to find out how much water is used in the reaction. From the third equation, we see that 1 mole of SO₃ reacts with 1 mole of water to produce H₂SO₄. So, if we start with 4.5 grams of water, we need to convert it to moles. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 g/mol.
4.5g / 18g/mol = 0.25 moles of water
Since 1 mole of SO₃ reacts with 1 mole of water, the maximum amount of Na₂SO₄ that can be produced is also 0.25 moles, as each mole of water will produce 1 mole of H₂SO₄ which will react with 2 moles of NaOH to give 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. 1 mole of Na₂SO₄, 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄

We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.

0: empty stack
1: { ; stack: {
2: ( ; stack: { (
3: { ; stack: { ( {
4: { ; stack: { ( { {
5: &lt; ; stack: { ( { { &lt;

22: ] ; stack: empty
23: > ; stack: empty
24: > ; stack: empty
25: } ; stack: empty

Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is empty.
We will need to pop out the elements one by one in the reverse order of the stack configuration.

So, we need to pop out the following elements:
- 2 closing brackets: ] ]
- 2 closing parentheses: ) )
- 2 closing angle brackets: > >
- 4 closing curly brackets: } }

So the answer is ] ) > > } }. </pre>

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/248
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a quail, a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a falcon, an owl, and a blue jay. The blue jay is to the left of the falcon. The blue jay is the second from the right. The raven is to the left of the robin. The owl is the third from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The raven is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The quail is the third from the right
(B) The raven is the third from the right
(C) The hummingbird is the third from the right
(D) The robin is the third from the right
(E) The falcon is the third from the right
(F) The owl is the third from the right
(G) The blue jay is the third from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The blue jay is to the left of the falcon: "(left)? blue jay? falcon? (right)".
(2) The blue jay is the second from the right: "(left)?? blue jay falcon (right)".
(3) The raven is to the left of the robin: "(left)? raven robin? (right)".
(4) The owl is the third from the right: "(left)??? owl blue jay falcon (right)".
(5) The hummingbird is to the left of the quail: "(left)? hummingbird quail? (right)".
(6) The raven is the third from the left: "(left) raven robin????? (right)".
(7) Combining (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) we get the following ordering: "(left) raven robin hummingbird quail owl blue jay falcon (right)".
According to this ordering, the third from the right is the blue jay.
The blue jay is the third from the right. So the answer is (G). </pre>

<pre> Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths.

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 31.00,73.00 L 32.00,59.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 49.00,41.00 L 64.00,37.00 L 71.00,55.00 L 64.00,76.00 L 52.00,61.00 L 31.00,73.00"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 14.19,26.04 L 51.43,39.21 L 58.44,36.69 L 56.63,30.17 L 48.53,26.66 L 14.19,26.04"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 58.00,35.00 L 84.00,35.00 A 26.00,26.00 0.00 0,1 32.26,38.67 L 58.00,35.00"/> draws a

###### answer
<pre> To analyze this path, let's break it down:

This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands, as well as an "A" command. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y). A takes the following parameters: Rx, Ry, phi, any flag, and a target x and y position. Rx and Ry are the x and y radii of the ellipse that approximates the curve. The theta is the angle of the closest point of the curve to the current point. "any flag" specifies the type of the line that the ellipse draws (clockwise, counterclockwise, bye).

This path can be decomposed into 4 separate commands.
(1) M 58.00,35.00: Move the current point to 58.00,35.00.
(2) L 84.00,35.00: Create a line from 58.00,35.00 to 84.00,35.00.
(3) A 26.00,26.00 0.00 0,1 32.26,38.67: This is where things get a bit more complicated.
    A is a quadratic Bézier curve where "any flag" is 0, and a smooth curve, setting "0,1," indicates 1 references point is taken from previous points on curve chart and starting at counter clockwise.
    However the statement in binary begins as (1) is used here- computer translates set bits start following from right

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:

(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We know the following: Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg, Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg.

We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

Now, we need to find the penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. 

The penguins that are more than 5 years old are Louis (7), Vincent (9), and Gwen (8).
The penguins that weigh more than 12 kg are Louis (11), Vincent (11), and Gwen (15).

The penguins that are both more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg are Louis and Vincent.

There are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. So the answer is (B). </pre>

<pre> Let's think step by step.

We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.

(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 6 steps backward: (0, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 8 steps left: (-8, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 3 steps right: (-5, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 7 steps forward: (2, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 3 steps right: (5, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 9 steps right: (14, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(8) Take 1 step backward: (14, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(9) Take 7 steps left: (7, -7), facing the positive y-axis.

Since (7, -7) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No. </pre>

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/74
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a bus, a motorcyle, a hatchback, a station wagon, a minivan, a truck, and a limousine. The station wagon is the fourth-newest. The motorcyle is newer than the truck. The station wagon is older than the hatchback. The minivan is newer than the hatchback. The bus is newer than the minivan. The truck is newer than the limousine.
Options:
(A) The bus is the newest
(B) The motorcyle is the newest
(C) The hatchback is the newest
(D) The station wagon is the newest
(E) The minivan is the newest
(F) The truck is the newest
(G) The limousine is the newest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To deduce the order of the vehicles, let's break down the given statements step by step.

(1) The station wagon is the fourth-newest: This means the order starts with at least three vehicles that are newer than the station wagon. 
(2) The motorcyle is newer than the truck: This tells us the motorcyle and truck are the two vehicles after the first three mentioned. The motorcyle is now in position 3 or later, and the truck in a position 4 or later.
(3) The station wagon is older than the hatchback: 
(4) The minivan is newer than the hatchback:  So, to fit both (3) and (4) into the list, the minivan is in a position 4 or later, the hatchback in a position 5 or later. Considering that  station wagon is in 4th position and newer than the hatchback but the minivan is newer than the hatchback, we find the minivan can be 4th, with station wagon no longer being 4th.
(5) The bus is newer than the minivan: The bus cannot be in the lead, because then two vehicles must come after it, which creates an impossibility that those 3 vehicles cannot come after the station wagon.
(6) The truck is newer than the limousine: We already know the truck's place is at least 4th, which forces the limousine to be in position 7 (worst-case scenario with the other 6 vehicles and order, or at the latest.) </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef
(B) Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is sarcastic.

(A) "Working at a restaurant has made me an amazing chef"

This statement is sarcastic. The speaker is implying that working at a restaurant has not made them an amazing chef, but rather the opposite. Working at a restaurant can provide some experience and skills, but it's unlikely to make someone an "amazing" chef overnight. The speaker is likely being ironic or facetious, suggesting that their experience at a restaurant has not lived up to their expectations or has not provided the level of expertise they had hoped for.

(B) "Working at a McDonald's has made me an amazing chef"

This statement is also sarcastic. Working at McDonald's is not typically associated with becoming an amazing chef, as the job often involves following a standardized menu and cooking procedures rather than creating original or complex dishes. The speaker is likely being sarcastic about the idea that working at McDonald's could possibly make someone an amazing chef.

In all three cases, the sarcastic options are the ones that imply the opposite of what they say, often to convey irony or criticism in a humorous way. </pre>

###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each option:

**Q: Which statement is sarcastic?**

(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal

The correct answer is (A). This sentence is sarcastic because it says the opposite of what is true. Having interests and actively researching them is typically beneficial, not a waste.

**Q: Which statement is sarcastic?**

(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case

The correct answer is (B). This sentence is sarcastic because it says that ad hominem attacks are helpful, which is the opposite of what is true. Ad hominem attacks are generally considered to be unhelpful and counterproductive.

**Q: Which statement is sarcastic?**

(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?

The correct answer is (A). This sentence is sarcastic because it likens the consistency in the league's punishments to politics, implying that it is unreliable or untrustworthy. This is a satirical comment, as politics is often associated with inconsistency and unpredictability.

**Q: Which statement is sarcastic?**

(A) He's a generous person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need
(B) He's a terrible person, trying to promote a charity stream that has raised millions to help kids in need

The correct answer is (B). This sentence is sarcastic because it says the opposite of what is true. The fact that the charity stream has raised millions to help kids in need suggests that the person is actually generous and kind, not terrible. </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Order adjectives correctly in English sentences.

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 &lt; 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship
(B) Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 &lt; 1 &lt; 8 &lt; 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) blue gold wonderful square shoe
(B) wonderful square blue gold shoe
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "blue gold wonderful square shoe". (1) "blue" falls into the color category. (2) "gold" falls into the material category. (3) "wonderful" falls into the opinion category. (4) "square" falls into the shape category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [5. color] [7. material] [1. opinion] [4. shape] (or, in numeric terms, 5 7 1 4). Because 5 &lt; 7 &lt; 1 &lt; 4 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "wonderful square blue gold shoe". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [4. shape] [5. color] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 4 5 7 ). Because 1 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) iron midsize dog
(B) midsize iron dog </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the options:

Option (A): "iron midsize dog". 
(1) "iron" falls into the material category. 
(2) "midsize" falls into the size category. 
The adjective order that Option (A) has is [7. material] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 7 2). Because 7 &lt; 2 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.

Option (B): "midsize iron dog". 
Option (B) has the following adjective order: [2. size] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 2 7). Because 2 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering.

However, since both options have the correct ordering, we need to look at the context of the question, which is asking for the sentence with the "correct adjective order". In this case, both options have the correct order, but the question is likely asking for the option that follows the standard order of adjectives. In that case, option (A) is the correct answer because it follows the standard order of adjectives: [7. material] [2. size].

So the answer is (A). </pre>

Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is "&lt; [ {".
We will need to pop out "{", "[", "&lt;" one by one in that order.
So, we need "}", "]", ">". So the answer is } ] >.

Q: Complete the rest of the sequence, making sure that the parentheses are closed properly. Input: [ &lt; { [ ] } > </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.
0: empty stack
1: [ ; stack: [
2: &lt; ; stack: [ &lt;
3: { ; stack: [ &lt; {
4: [ ; stack: [ &lt; { [
5: ] ; stack: [ &lt; { [
6: } ; stack: [ &lt; {
7: > ; stack: [ &lt; }
8: > fixed with the opening and closing bracket for the previous slot
Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is "[ &lt; {".
However the stack for this configuration is  [ &lt; { .
We will need to pop out "{", "&lt;", "[" one by one in that order.
So the answer is } > ]. </pre>

### snarks/108
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Whistleblowers are great, heroes, they're in the public interest. They're accusing one of us? Back them up
(B) Whistleblowers are great, heroes, they're in the public interest. They're accusing one of us? Lock them up </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each statement to determine which one is sarcastic.

**Statement 1:**
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal

The correct answer is (A). This statement is sarcastic because it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, which is the opposite of what is typically true. It's ironic and humorous to say that researching one's interests is a waste of time.

**Statement 2:**
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case

The correct answer is (B). This statement is sarcastic because it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, which is the opposite of what is typically true. Ad hominem attacks are generally considered to be unhelpful and counterproductive.

**Statement 3:**
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?

The correct answer is (A). This statement is sarcastic because it likens the consistency in the league's punishments to politics, implying that it's a joke or a farce. Politics is often associated with inconsistency and unpredictability, so the comparison is ironic and humorous.

**Statement 4:**
(A) Whistleblowers are great, heroes, they're in the public interest. They're accusing one of us? Back them up
(B) Whistleblowers are great, heroes, they're in the public interest. They're accusing one of us? Lock them up

The correct answer is (B). This statement is sarcastic because it says that whistleblowers should be locked up, which is the opposite of what is typically true. Whistleblowers are often praised and protected for speaking out in the public interest. The statement is ironic and humorous, implying that the speaker is being facetious. </pre>

(D) 10/23/1966
(E) 02/23/1968
(F) 02/23/1966 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the context of each question to infer the date.

Q: Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?

Context: Christmas Eve of 1937

Inferred date: December 24, 1937

Q: Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Context: Tomorrow is 11/12/2019

Inferred date: November 11, 2019

Q: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?

Context: 5-year anniversary of marriage on Jan 2, 1958

Inferred date: January 2, 1963

Q: Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

Context: Second day of the third month of 1966

Inferred date: March 2, 1966

To find the date one week ago, we need to subtract 7 days from March 2, 1966.

March 2, 1966 - 7 days = February 25, 1966

However, none of the options match this date. Let's re-examine the options.

Since the second day of the third month of 1966 is March 2, 1966, we can infer that the third month is March. The options that mention February (A, B, and F) are not correct.

The correct answer is not among the options. However, we can calculate the correct answer:

March 2, 1966 - 7 days = February 25, 1966

This date is not among the options. </pre>

### multistep_arithmetic_two/9
###### instruction
<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 * -7)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to follow the order of operations (PEMDAS):

1. Evaluate the expressions inside the parentheses:
   A = (-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) = (-9 - (1 * 5 * -5)) = (-9 - (1 * -25)) = (-9 - (-25)) = -9 + 25 = 16
   B = (6 + -3 - -1 * -7) = (6 + -3 - (1 * -7)) = (6 + -3 - (-7)) = (6 + -3 + 7) = 10

2. Now, substitute the values of A and B back into the original equation:
   (-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 * -7) = 16 - 10 = 6

The final answer is: 6 </pre>

For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of the items she has chosen and subtract that from her budget.

1. **Cost of the computer**: €1090
2. **Cost of the screen**: €157
3. **Cost of the keyboard and mouse**: €74
4. **Cost of the CD burner**: €74
5. **Cost of the printer**: €102

First, we sum up the costs of all the items:

\[
1090 + 157 + 74 + 74 + 102
\]

Let's add these step by step:

\[
1090 + 157 = 1247
\]

\[
1247 + 74 = 1321
\]

\[
1321 + 74 = 1395
\]

\[
1395 + 102 = 1497
\]

The total cost of the items is €1497.

Next, we subtract this total from Elvira's budget of €1500:

\[
1500 - 1497 = 3
\]

Therefore, the amount of money Elvira will have left for her clothing is:

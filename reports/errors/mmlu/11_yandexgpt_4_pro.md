Superheated steam enters an adiabatic turbine at 400 lbf/in^2, 600°F and leaves at a pressure of 50 lbf/in^2 and a quality of 99.5%. If the temperature of the surroundings (T_0) is 60°F, calculate the turbine efficiency, effectiveness, and loss of available energy.

J) Turbine efficiency: 65%, Effectiveness: 90%, Loss of available energy: -37 Btu/lbm </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to calculate the turbine efficiency, effectiveness, and loss of available energy.

1. Turbine efficiency:
The turbine efficiency is given by the ratio of the work done by the turbine to the heat input. We can use the enthalpy values for superheated steam at the inlet and outlet conditions to find the work done.

2. Effectiveness:
Effectiveness is a measure of how well a turbine converts the available energy into useful work. It is given by the ratio of actual work output to maximum possible work output.

3. Loss of available energy:
Loss of available energy is the difference between the heat input and the work output.

Let's start with the given data:
- Inlet pressure: 400 lbf/in^2
- Inlet temperature: 600°F
- Outlet pressure: 50 lbf/in^2
- Outlet quality: 99.5%
- Surrounding temperature: 60°F

We can use steam tables or software to find the enthalpies at the inlet and outlet conditions. Let's assume we have the following values:
- Enthalpy at inlet: h1 = 1800 Btu/lbm
- Enthalpy at outlet: h2 = 700 Btu/lbm (approximate value)

Now we can calculate the work done:
Work done = h1 - h2
Work done = 1800 - 700
Work done = 1100 Btu/lbm

Next, let's calculate the turbine efficiency:
Turbine efficiency = Work done / Heat input
Heat input = h1
Turbine efficiency = 1100 / 1800
Turbine efficiency ≈ 0.611 or 61.1% (rounded to two decimal places)

To calculate effectiveness, we need more information about the maximum possible work output. Without that information, we cannot calculate effectiveness.

Finally, let's calculate the loss of available energy:
Loss of available energy = Heat input - Work done
Loss of available energy = 1800 - 1100
Loss of available energy = 700 Btu/lbm

Based on the given options, the closest answer is:

The height of a hill in meters is given by $z=2 x y-3 x^2-4 y^2-18 x+28 y+12$, where $x$ is the distance east and $y$ is the distance north of the origin. What is the $x$ distance of the top of the hill?

A) 3m
B) -1m
C) 4m
D) 6m
E) 2m
F) -3m
G)  -2m 
H) 5m
I) 0m
J) 1m </pre>
###### answer
<pre> We want to find the $x$-coordinate of the top of the hill, which is the maximum or minimum point of the height function.
To do this, we need to find the critical points of the function by taking partial derivatives with respect to $x$ and $y$, setting them equal to zero, and solving for $x$ and $y$.
Taking the partial derivative with respect to $x$, we have:
$\frac{\partial z}{\partial x} = 2y - 6x - 18$
Setting this equal to zero and solving for $x$, we get:
$2y - 6x - 18 = 0$
$6x = 2y - 18$
$x = \frac{y}{3} - 3$
Now, taking the partial derivative with respect to $y$, we have:
$\frac{\partial z}{\partial y} = 2x - 8y + 28$
Again, setting this equal to zero and solving for $y$, we get:
$2x - 8y + 28 = 0$
$8y = 2x + 28$
$y = \frac{x}{4} + 7$
Substituting this value of $y$ into the equation for $x$, we find:
$x = \frac{(\frac{x}{4} + 7)}{3} - 3$
Simplifying, we get:
$4x = (\frac{x}{4} + 7) - 12$
$4x = \frac{x}{4} - 5$
Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fraction, we obtain:
$16x = x - 20$
$15x = -20$
$x = -\frac{4}{3}$
Since the question asks for the $x$ distance of the top of the hill, the answer is not a negative value. Therefore, we must consider the positive value of $x$.
The only option that is close to our result is E) 2m. However, since our result was negative, it's clear that none of the given options are correct.

Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system. The following are inventory transactions for the month of January: 1/1 Beginning inventory 20000 units at $13 1/20 Purchase 30000 units at $15 1/23 Purchase 40000 units at $17 1/31 Sales at $20 per unit 50000 units Ultra uses the LIFO method to determine the value of its inventory. What amount should Ultra report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January?

A) $810,000
B) 1000000
C) $1,030,000
D) $830,000
E) $1,100,000
F) $870,000
G) $750,000
H) $950,000
I) $710,000
J) $910,000 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Beginning inventory: 20,000 units * $13 = $260,000
First purchase: 20,000 units (from beginning inventory) * $15 = $300,000
Second purchase: (50,000 - 20,000) units = 30,000 units
Last purchase: 30,000 units * $17 = $510,000
Total cost of goods sold: $260,000 + $300,000 + $510,000 = $1,070,000 (but only for 50,000 sold units)
Cost of goods sold per unit: $1,070,000 / 50,000 units = $21.40 per unit
Cost of goods sold for the month of January: 50,000 units sold * $21.40 = $1,070,000

The nucleus of a plutonium-239 atom contains 94 protons. Assume that the nucleus is a sphere with radius $6.64 \mathrm{fm}$ and with the charge of the protons uniformly spread through the sphere. At the surface of the nucleus, what are the magnitude of the electric field produced by the protons?

I) $2.75$$10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
J) $1.92 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The magnitude of the electric field at the surface of a charged sphere can be calculated using the formula:

$E = \frac{k * Q}{r^2}$,

where $E$ is the electric field, $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($9 * 10^9 \mathrm{~N} * \mathrm{m}^2 / \mathrm{C}^2$), $Q$ is the total charge on the sphere, and $r$ is the radius of the sphere.

In this case, we know that the nucleus contains 94 protons, each with a charge of +1.602 * $10^{-19}$ C. So the total charge $Q$ on the nucleus is:

$Q = 94 * 1.602 * 10^{-19} \mathrm{~C}$.

Substituting this into the formula, we get:

$E = \frac{(9 * 10^9) * (94 * 1.602 * 10^{-19})}{(6.64 * 10^{-15})^2}$.

Calculating this expression gives us:

$E ≈ 5.33 * 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$.

Which is the best buy?

A) 7 bottles of juice for $15.75
B) 5 bottles of juice for $11.25
C) 9 bottles of juice for $20.25
D) 4 bottles of juice for $9.00
E) 11 bottles of juice for $24.86
F) 12 bottles of juice for $27.00
G) 16 bottles of juice for $35.68
H) 18 bottles of juice for $40.50
I) 14 bottles of juice for $31.50
J) 3 bottles of juice for $6.72 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the best buy, we need to compare the unit price of each option.
Let's calculate the unit price for each option:
A) 7 bottles for $15.75, so the unit price is $15.75 / 7 = $2.25 per bottle.
B) 5 bottles for $11.25, so the unit price is $11.25 / 5 = $2.25 per bottle.
C) 9 bottles for $20.25, so the unit price is $20.25 / 9 = $2.25 per bottle.
D) 4 bottles for $9.00, so the unit price is $9.00 / 4 = $2.25 per bottle.
E) 11 bottles for $24.86, so the unit price is $24.86 / 11 = $2.26 per bottle.
F) 12 bottles for $27.00, so the unit price is $27.00 / 12 = $2.25 per bottle.
G) 16 bottles for $35.68, so the unit price is $35.68 / 16 = $2.23 per bottle.
H) 18 bottles for $40.50, so the unit price is $40.50 / 18 = $2.25 per bottle.
I) 14 bottles for $31.50, so the unit price is $31.50 / 14 = $2.25 per bottle.
J) 3 bottles for $6.72, so the unit price is $6.72 / 3 = $2.24 per bottle.

The unit prices are almost identical for all options except for E and G, which have slightly higher unit prices. Therefore, the best buys are A, B, D, F, H, I, and J, as they all have the same unit price of $2.25. However, since we want to choose one option, let's compare the total quantity of bottles in each option. Among these options, A (7 bottles), B (5 bottles), and D (4 bottles) have fewer bottles than others. So, considering both the unit price and the quantity, the most favorable option is D.

A major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election (in terms of the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate). They intend to use a 95% confidence interval with margin of error of no more than 2.5%. What is the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal?

A) 2048
B) 1000
C) 39
D) 1536
E) 2000
F) 40
G) 1024
H) 1537
I) 4096
J) 500 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the minimum sample size needed to achieve a 95% confidence interval with a margin of error of no more than 2.5%, we can use the formula for calculating the sample size:

n = (Z^2 * p * (1 - p)) / E^2

where:
- n is the sample size,
- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (for a 95% confidence level, Z ≈ 1.96),
- p is the estimated proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate (we don't have an estimate for this, so we'll assume it's 0.5 for simplicity),
- E is the margin of error (2.5%).

Let's plug in these values:

n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1 - 0.5)) / (0.025^2)
n ≈ (3.8416 * 0.25) / 0.000625
n ≈ 1536

So, the minimum sample size required to accomplish the goal is approximately 1536.

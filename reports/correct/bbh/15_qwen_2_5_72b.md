### logical_deduction_five_objects/217
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: mangoes, kiwis, plums, pears, and watermelons. The kiwis are less expensive than the plums. The pears are the third-most expensive. The kiwis are the second-cheapest. The watermelons are the most expensive.
Options:
(A) The mangoes are the second-most expensive
(B) The kiwis are the second-most expensive
(C) The plums are the second-most expensive
(D) The pears are the second-most expensive
(E) The watermelons are the second-most expensive </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
(1) The kiwis are less expensive than the plums: "(cheapest) ? kiwis ? plums ? (most expensive)".
(2) The pears are the third-most expensive: "(cheapest) ? ? pears ? ? (most expensive)".
(3) The kiwis are the second-cheapest: "(cheapest) kiwis ? pears ? ? (most expensive)".
(4) The watermelons are the most expensive: "(cheapest) kiwis ? pears ? watermelons (most expensive)".
(5) Combining (1), (2), (3), and (4) we get the following ordering: "(cheapest) kiwis ? pears plums watermelons (most expensive)".
(6) Since the pears are the third-most expensive, the only position left for the plums is the second-most expensive: "(cheapest) kiwis ? pears plums watermelons (most expensive)".
(7) The only fruit left to place is the mangoes, which must be the second-cheapest: "(cheapest) kiwis mangoes pears plums watermelons (most expensive)".

According to this ordering, the plums are the second-most expensive.
The plums are the second-most expensive. So the answer is (C). </pre>

### formal_fallacies/235
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First, being an ex-supporter of FC Sion is necessary for being a devotee of FK Kukësi. Second, it is not the case that Kylie is an ex-supporter of FC Sion. So, necessarily, it is false that Kylie is a devotee of FK Kukësi."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine if it is deductively valid.

1. **Premise 1**: Being an ex-supporter of FC Sion is necessary for being a devotee of FK Kukësi.
   - This can be formalized as: If X is a devotee of FK Kukësi, then X is an ex-supporter of FC Sion.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Devotee}(X, \text{FK Kukësi}) \rightarrow \text{Ex-Supporter}(X, \text{FC Sion}) \).

2. **Premise 2**: It is not the case that Kylie is an ex-supporter of FC Sion.
   - Symbolically: \( \neg \text{Ex-Supporter}(Kylie, \text{FC Sion}) \).

3. **Conclusion**: It is false that Kylie is a devotee of FK Kukësi.
   - Symbolically: \( \neg \text{Devotee}(Kylie, \text{FK Kukësi}) \).

To determine if the argument is valid, we need to see if the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

**Step-by-Step Reasoning:**

1. From Premise 1, we have:
   - \( \text{Devotee}(X, \text{FK Kukësi}) \rightarrow \text{Ex-Supporter}(X, \text{FC Sion}) \).

2. From Premise 2, we have:
   - \( \neg \text{Ex-Supporter}(Kylie, \text{FC Sion}) \).

3. We need to determine if \( \neg \text{Devotee}(Kylie, \text{FK Kukësi}) \) follows from these premises.

Using the contrapositive of Premise 1:
- The contrapositive of \( \text{Devotee}(X, \text{FK Kukësi}) \rightarrow \text{Ex-Supporter}(X, \text{FC Sion}) \) is:
  - \( \neg \text{Ex-Supporter}(X, \text{FC Sion}) \rightarrow \neg \text{Devotee}(X, \text{FK Kukësi}) \).

4. Applying the contrapositive to Kylie:
   - Since \( \neg \text{Ex-Supporter}(Kylie, \text{FC Sion}) \) (from Premise 2), we can conclude:
     - \( \neg \text{Devotee}(Kylie, \text{FK Kukësi}) \).

Therefore, the conclusion \( \neg \text{Devotee}(Kylie, \text{FK Kukësi}) \) logically follows from the premises.

So, the argument is **valid**. </pre>

### disambiguation_qa/242
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Alex told us that they could not meet.
Options:
(A) Alex could not meet
(B) We could not meet
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they," namely Alex and "us." The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Alex and Y be "us." The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) could not meet."

Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y could not meet." This case makes sense, because X is informing Y about Y's inability to meet. However, it is less common for someone to inform others about their own inability to meet, especially in a direct statement like this.

Now, consider X: "X told Y that X could not meet." This case also makes sense, because X is informing Y about X's own inability to meet. This is a more common and natural way to communicate such information.

Because the context and the structure of the sentence suggest that it is more likely for X (Alex) to be informing Y (us) about X's own inability to meet, the answer should be that Alex could not meet.

So the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
In Bash Ball, opposing teams try to score points in the other team's zone by entering it. On each team, there are two types of players: Bashers and Runners. During the game, Bashers remain in the same spot, trying to hit the other team's Runners with balls, and Runners try to enter the other team's zone without getting hit. Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is not allowed to talk to Runners, Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the remainder of the game. Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. **Context and Roles**: In Bash Ball, Bashers remain in one spot and try to hit the other team's Runners with balls, while Runners try to enter the other team's zone without getting hit. Zach is a Basher, and Harmon is a Runner.

2. **Zach's Observation**: Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers hiding behind a tree. This information could potentially help Harmon avoid getting hit.

3. **Zach's Action (or Lack Thereof)**: Zach knows he is not allowed to communicate with Runners, so he does not tell Harmon about the Basher's location.

4. **Outcome**: Harmon gets hit by the Basher that Zach spotted and is out for the remainder of the game.

5. **Causal Attribution**: The question is whether Harmon being out of the game is because Zach did not tell him where the Basher was. A typical person would consider the following:
   - **Direct Causation**: The Basher hitting Harmon is the direct cause of Harmon being out.
   - **Indirect Causation**: Zach's decision not to communicate the Basher's location to Harmon could be seen as an indirect cause, as it deprived Harmon of information that might have helped him avoid being hit.

6. **Moral and Social Considerations**: While Zach's action (or lack thereof) did not directly cause the hit, it can be argued that his adherence to the rules (not communicating with Runners) contributed to the outcome. However, a typical person might also recognize that the rules of the game are designed to prevent such communication, and thus Zach's adherence to the rules is not a violation of expected behavior.

Given these considerations, a typical person would likely answer:

- **No**: Harmon being out of the game is primarily due to the Basher hitting him, not because Zach did not tell him where the Basher was. Zach's adherence to the game's rules is a normal part of the game and does not constitute a direct cause of Harmon's elimination. </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Given a series of navigation instructions, determine whether one would end up back at the starting point.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn around. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Take 2 steps. Take 4 steps. Take 8 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 2 steps: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 4 steps: (0, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 8 steps: (0, 21), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 21) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn around. Take 6 steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (0, -1), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (0, -7), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Turn around: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (0, -1), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (0, 8), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Take 7 steps right.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: First of all, every frequent consumer of Pre De Provence soap is not a rare consumer of Aussie shampoo and not a frequent consumer of Bio Ionic shampoo. From this follows: No frequent consumer of Bio Ionic shampoo and no rare consumer of Aussie shampoo is a frequent consumer of Pre De Provence soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step to determine if it is deductively valid.

### Premise:
1. Every frequent consumer of Pre De Provence soap is not a rare consumer of Aussie shampoo and not a frequent consumer of Bio Ionic shampoo.
   - Formally: If X = frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Aussie) AND frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic)).

### Conclusion:
- No frequent consumer of Bio Ionic shampoo and no rare consumer of Aussie shampoo is a frequent consumer of Pre De Provence soap.
  - Formally: If X = frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic) OR X = rare-consumer(Aussie), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence)).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Premise Analysis:**
   - The premise states that if someone is a frequent consumer of Pre De Provence soap, they cannot be both a rare consumer of Aussie shampoo and a frequent consumer of Bio Ionic shampoo.
   - This can be broken down into two parts:
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Aussie)).
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic)).

2. **Conclusion Analysis:**
   - The conclusion states that if someone is either a frequent consumer of Bio Ionic shampoo or a rare consumer of Aussie shampoo, they cannot be a frequent consumer of Pre De Provence soap.
   - This can be broken down into:
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence)).
     - If X = rare-consumer(Aussie), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence)).

3. **Logical Deduction:**
   - From the premise, we know:
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Aussie)).
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic)).
   - This means:
     - If X = rare-consumer(Aussie), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence)).
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence)).

4. **Conclusion Verification:**
   - The conclusion states exactly what we have deduced from the premise:
     - If X = frequent-consumer(Bio Ionic) OR X = rare-consumer(Aussie), then X = NOT (frequent-consumer(Pre De Provence)).

Since the conclusion logically follows from the premise, the argument is deductively valid.

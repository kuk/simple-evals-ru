Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble shampoo).

(2) So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble shampoo), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble shampoo), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove)?

Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?

By (1), we have if X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble shampoo).

By (2), we have if X = owner(Bumble and bumble shampoo), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove).

So, it is true that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap. Therefore, the answer is valid. </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: $\neg$Manuel = half-brother(Chester).

(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ancestor(Jeremy), then X = NOT (half-brother(Chester)).

Hypothesis: Is it true that it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy: $\neg$(Manuel = ancestor(Jeremy))?

Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?

By (1), we have $\neg$(Manuel = half-brother(Chester)).

From (2), we infer that if Manuel is a half-brother of Chester, then he cannot be an ancestor of Jeremy. Since we know from (1) that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester, it must be because he doesn't meet the condition where he could be an ancestor of Jeremy.

Therefore, by modus tollens, we can logically conclude that $\neg$(Manuel = ancestor(Jeremy)).

So, it is true that it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy. Therefore, the answer is valid. </pre>

<pre> Select the humorous edit that 'ruins' the input movie or musical artist name.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'batman begins'?
Options:
(A) barman begins
(B) batman bewins
(C) hatman begins
(D) batman begin </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think through each option systematically:

1. **Original Name**: "batman begins" – A famous film directed by Christopher Nolan, part of the Batman film series.
  
2. **Option Analysis**:
    - **(A) Barman Begins**: The word "batman" changes to "barman." While it introduces humor due to potential confusion with a bartender, it doesn’t exactly “ruin” the name.
    - **(B) Batman Bewins**: Adding the suffix "-bewins" humorously suggests that Batman might have won something, likely poking fun at him. This qualifies as a humorous edit that significantly alters the original name.
    - **(C) Hatman Begins**: Changing "batman" to "hatman" introduces a playful twist related to headgear, potentially amusing but less impactful on ruining the name.
    - **(D) Batman Begin**: Simply dropping the "s" from "begins" does not substantially alter the name or introduce significant humor.

Given these arguments, the most effective humorous edit that significantly alters the name "batman begins" is:

**Answer**: (B) batman bewins </pre>

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((3 * 8 * -1 * -9) - (-2 + 2 * -8 * 8)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's solve this step by step.

First, simplify each part of the expression separately:

1. **Simplify $3 \times 8 \times -1 \times -9$:**
   \[
   3 \times 8 = 24
   \]
   \[
   24 \times -1 = -24
   \]
   \[
   -24 \times -9 = 216
   \]

2. **Simplify $-(-2 + 2 \times -8 \times 8)$:**
   \[
   2 \times -8 = -16
   \]
   \[
   -16 \times 8 = -128
   \]
   \[
   -128 + 2 = -126
   \]
   \[
   -(-126) = 126
   \]

Now subtract the second simplified result from the first:
\[
216 - 126 = 90
\]

So, the value of the given expression is $\boxed{90}$. </pre>

Q: Find a movie similar to Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, Aladdin, The Lion King:
Options:
(A) Terminator 2 Judgment Day
(B) The Next Three Days
(C) Detachment
(D) Ruby Sparks </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

- Pulp Fiction (crime, drama, thriller; 1994): Known for its nonlinear storytelling, dark humor, and eclectic character portrayal.
- The Shawshank Redemption (drama, crime; 1994): Features prison life and themes of hope and redemption.
- Aladdin (family, adventure, fantasy; 1992): An animated Disney film filled with magic, adventure, and musical numbers.
- The Lion King (animated, adventure, family; 1994): Another popular Disney animation with animal characters and an African savannah setting.

Considering the genre and tone of these films, we need a movie that has elements of crime or drama, combined with memorable characters and possibly some dark humor.

Analyzing the options:

(A) Terminator 2: Judgment Day – While this is a great action movie with strong characters, it doesn’t have the same blend of genres or the quirky humor found in Pulp Fiction or The Shawshank Redemption.

(B) The Next Three Days – This is more of a straightforward thriller about a woman planning to break her husband out of jail. It lacks the unique style and humor seen in Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption.

(C) Detachment – This film focuses on the lives of teachers and students in an inner-city school. Although it deals with serious themes like alienation and survival, it does not match the specific mix of genres and tones found in the other four movies.

(D) Ruby Sparks – This movie tells the story of a young writer who creates a fictional girlfriend who becomes real. It explores themes of control and relationships but isn’t quite aligned with the darker, grittier aspects of Pulp Fiction or The Shawshank Redemption.

Given these considerations, none of the options perfectly matches the combination of genres and mood present in Pulp Fiction, The Shawshank Redemption, Aladdin, and The Lion King. However, if one had to choose among these options based on overall vibe and character complexity, **The Next Three Days** might come closest due to its intense focus on characters and their psychological struggles.

So the best choice would likely be:

**(B) The Next Three Days** </pre>

Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".

Options:
(A) The robin is the second from the left
(B) The owl is the second from the left
(C) The hawk is the second from the left </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are three birds: a robin, an owl, and a hawk. The robin is to the right of the hawk. The owl is the leftmost.

Options:
(A) The robin is the second from the left  
(B) The owl is the second from the left  
(C) The hawk is the second from the left

Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Owl is the leftmost**: This means the owl is positioned before any other bird on the branch. Therefore, the owl cannot be in the second position. Hence, options (A) and (C) can be ruled out because they suggest the owl being in the second position.
   
2. **Robin is to the right of the hawk**: Since the owl is the leftmost and hence ahead of both the robin and the hawk, it implies that the robin must be positioned after the hawk when moving towards the right on the branch. 

Combining these two pieces of information:

- The owl is in the leftmost position.
- The robin comes after the hawk.

Therefore, the only remaining valid option is:

(B) The owl is the second from the left </pre>

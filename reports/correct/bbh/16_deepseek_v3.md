### disambiguation_qa/100
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.
Options:
(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
(B) The receptionist was in a good mood
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "she", namely the mechanic and the receptionist. The verb "greets" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the mechanic and Y the receptionist. The sentence is then of the form "X greets Y because (X or Y) was in a good mood."
Let's consider Y first: "X greets Y because Y was in a good mood." This case makes sense, because X might greet Y because Y was in a good mood.
Now, consider X: "X greets Y because X was in a good mood." This case also makes sense, because X might greet Y because X was in a good mood.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C). </pre>

<pre> Order adjectives correctly in English sentences.

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 &lt; 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship
(B) Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 &lt; 1 &lt; 8 &lt; 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) blue gold wonderful square shoe
(B) wonderful square blue gold shoe
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "blue gold wonderful square shoe". (1) "blue" falls into the color category. (2) "gold" falls into the material category. (3) "wonderful" falls into the opinion category. (4) "square" falls into the shape category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [5. color] [7. material] [1. opinion] [4. shape] (or, in numeric terms, 5 7 1 4). Because 5 &lt; 7 &lt; 1 &lt; 4 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "wonderful square blue gold shoe". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [4. shape] [5. color] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 4 5 7 ). Because 1 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "square cardboard old-fashioned Japanese exercise white motorcycle". (1) "square" falls into the shape category. (2) "cardboard" falls into the material category. (3) "old-fashioned" falls into the age category. (4) "Japanese" falls into the origin category. (5) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. (6) "white" falls into the color category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [4. shape] [7. material] [3. age] [6. origin] [8. purpose] [5. color] (or, in numeric terms, 4 7 3 6 8 5). Because 4 &lt; 7 &lt; 3 &lt; 6 &lt; 8 &lt; 5 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "old-fashioned square white Japanese cardboard exercise motorcycle". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 3 4 5 6 7 8). Because 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 7 &lt; 8 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the machine will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. A typical person would assume that the black wire is the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is not supposed to touch the battery. Since both wires ended up touching the battery at the same time, causing the short circuit, a typical person would likely conclude that the black wire did not cause the short circuit on its own. Instead, the short circuit was caused by the combination of both wires touching the battery simultaneously. Therefore, the answer is No. </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, everyone who is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi is a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita. Moreover, every close friend of Kathryn is a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie. It follows that whoever is none of this: a cousin of Valerie or classmate of Mitzi, is a workmate of Anita."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Everyone who is neither a cousin of Valerie nor a classmate of Mitzi is a close friend of Kathryn or a workmate of Anita: If X = NOT (cousin(Valerie)) AND NOT (classmate(Mitzi)), then X = close-friend(Kathryn) OR workmate(Anita).
(2) Every close friend of Kathryn is a classmate of Mitzi or a cousin of Valerie: If X = close-friend(Kathryn), then X = classmate(Mitzi) OR cousin(Valerie).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is none of this: a cousin of Valerie or classmate of Mitzi, is a workmate of Anita: If X = NOT (cousin(Valerie)) AND NOT (classmate(Mitzi)), then X = workmate(Anita)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = NOT (cousin(Valerie)) AND NOT (classmate(Mitzi)), then X = close-friend(Kathryn) OR workmate(Anita).
By (2), we have if X = close-friend(Kathryn), then X = classmate(Mitzi) OR cousin(Valerie).
However, the Hypothesis requires that if X = NOT (cousin(Valerie)) AND NOT (classmate(Mitzi)), then X = workmate(Anita). This does not follow because (1) allows for the possibility that X = close-friend(Kathryn), and (2) does not exclude the case where X = close-friend(Kathryn) AND (X = classmate(Mitzi) OR cousin(Valerie)), which contradicts the Hypothesis. Therefore, the argument is invalid.
So the answer is invalid. </pre>

We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.
0: empty stack
1: &lt; ; stack: &lt;
2: &lt; ; stack: &lt; &lt;
3: [ ; stack: &lt; &lt; [
4: ] ; stack: &lt; &lt;
5: > ; stack: &lt;
6: ( ; stack: &lt; (
7: &lt; ; stack: &lt; ( &lt;
8: > ; stack: &lt; (
9: ) ; stack: &lt;
10: &lt; ; stack: &lt; &lt;
Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is "&lt; &lt;".
We will need to pop out "&lt;", "&lt;" one by one in that order.
So, we need ">", ">". So the answer is > >. </pre>

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/248
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a quail, a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a falcon, an owl, and a blue jay. The blue jay is to the left of the falcon. The blue jay is the second from the right. The raven is to the left of the robin. The owl is the third from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The raven is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The quail is the third from the right
(B) The raven is the third from the right
(C) The hummingbird is the third from the right
(D) The robin is the third from the right
(E) The falcon is the third from the right
(F) The owl is the third from the right
(G) The blue jay is the third from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The blue jay is the second from the right: This places the blue jay in the 6th position (since there are 7 birds).
(2) The owl is the third from the right: This places the owl in the 5th position.
(3) The raven is the third from the left: This places the raven in the 3rd position.
(4) The blue jay is to the left of the falcon: Since the blue jay is in the 6th position, the falcon must be in the 7th position.
(5) The raven is to the left of the robin: The raven is in the 3rd position, so the robin must be in a position to the right of the 3rd.
(6) The hummingbird is to the left of the quail: This places the hummingbird in a position to the left of the quail.
(7) Based on the above deductions, the positions are: 1st (unknown), 2nd (unknown), 3rd (raven), 4th (unknown), 5th (owl), 6th (blue jay), 7th (falcon).
(8) The third from the right is the 5th position, which is occupied by the owl.
The owl is the third from the right. So the answer is (F). </pre>

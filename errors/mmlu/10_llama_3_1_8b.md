The length and width of a rectangle are measured as $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $24 \mathrm{~cm}$, respectively, with an error in measurement of at most $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ in each. Use differentials to estimate the maximum error in the calculated area of the rectangle.


A) 9.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
B)  5.4 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
C) 12.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
D) 2.4 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
E) 8.1 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
F) 10.2 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
G) 6.2 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
H) 3.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
I) 4.8 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
J) 7.5 $\mathrm{cm^2}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let $A$ be the area of the rectangle. Then $A=L W$ where $L$ is the length and $W$ is the width. Then $\Delta A \approx \frac{\partial A}{\partial L} \Delta L+\frac{\partial A}{\partial W} \Delta W$ where $\Delta L$ and $\Delta W$ are the errors in measurement. Then $\frac{\partial A}{\partial L}=W$ and $\frac{\partial A}{\partial W}=L$ so that $\Delta A \approx W \Delta L+L \Delta W$. Substituting $L=30 \mathrm{~cm}$, $W=24 \mathrm{~cm}$, $\Delta L=0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$, and $\Delta W=0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$, we have $\Delta A \approx(24 \mathrm{~cm})(0.1 \mathrm{~cm})+(30 \mathrm{~cm})(0.1 \mathrm{~cm})=4.8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}+3.0 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=7.8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$. However, the question asks for the maximum error, and the error in the area is maximized when both errors are positive. Therefore, the maximum error is $4.8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}+3.0 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}=7.8 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$, but this is not among the choices. However, the closest answer is $7.5 \mathrm{~cm}^{2}$.

Compute the stresses in a saw as it goes over the driving pulley. The saw is made up of alloy steel, E = 30 × 10^6 psi, thickness = (1 / 32"). The pulley has a diameter of 15 in.

A) 25,000 psi
B) 15,000 psi
C) 30,000 psi
D) 7,500 psi
E) 62,500 psi
F) 40,000 psi
G) 12,000 psi
H) 55,000 psi
I) 45,000 psi
J) 20,000 psi </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The stress in the saw is given by the equation \(\sigma=\frac{F}{A}=\frac{F}{t w}\), where \(t\) is the thickness of the saw and \(w\) is the width of the saw. The width of the saw is equal to the diameter of the pulley, which is 15 in. The thickness of the saw is given as 1 / 32 in. Therefore, the stress in the saw is \(\sigma=\frac{F}{t w}=\frac{F}{\left(\frac{1}{32}\right)(15)}=\frac{F}{\frac{15}{32}}= \frac{32 F}{15}\) psi. The force \(F\) is equal to the tension in the belt, which is given by the equation \(T=\frac{W}{g}\left(\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}\right)^{2}\), where \(W\) is the weight of the saw, \(g\) is the acceleration due to gravity, and \(v_{1}\) and \(v_{2}\) are the velocities of the belt before and after the pulley, respectively. The velocity of the belt before the pulley is equal to the velocity of the saw, which is given by the equation \(v_{1}=\frac{2 \pi r}{60}\), where \(r\) is the radius of the saw. The velocity of the belt after the pulley is equal to the velocity of the saw, which is given by the equation \(v_{2}=\frac{2 \pi r}{60}\). Therefore, the tension in the belt is \(T=\frac{W}{g}\left(\frac{v_{2}}{v_{1}}\right)^{2}=\frac{W}{g}\left(\frac{\frac{2 \pi r}{60}}{\frac{2 \pi r}{60}}\right)^{2}=W\). The weight of the saw is given by the equation \(W=m g\), where \(m\) is the mass of the saw. The mass of the saw is equal to the density of the saw times the volume of the saw, which is given by the equation \(m=\rho V\), where \(\rho\) is the density of the saw and \(V\) is the volume of the saw. The volume of the saw is equal to the area of the saw times the thickness of the saw, which is given by the equation \(V=A t\), where \(A\) is the area of the saw. The area of the saw is equal to the width of the saw times the length of the saw, which is given by the equation \(A=w L\), where \(L\) is the length of the saw. Therefore, the mass of the saw is \(m=\rho V=\rho A t=\rho w L t\). The weight of the saw is \(W=m g=\rho w L t g\). Therefore, the tension in the belt is \(T=W=\rho w L t g\). The force \(F\) is equal to the tension in the belt, which is \(\rho w L t g\). Therefore, the stress in the saw is \(\sigma=\frac{F}{t w}=\frac{\rho w L t g}{t w}=\rho L g\). The density of the saw is given as 30 × 10^6 psi / (2 × 10^6 psi / in^2) = 15 lb/in^3. The length of the saw is given as 12 in. The acceleration due to gravity is given as 32.2 ft/s^2 = 386.4 in/s^2. Therefore, the stress in the saw is \(\sigma=\rho L g=(15 \mathrm{lb} / \mathrm{in}^{3})(12 \mathrm{in})(386.4 \mathrm{in} / \mathrm{s}^{2})=55,000 \mathrm{psi}\).

In systems with support for automatic memory management, a garbage collector typically has the responsibility for reclaiming allocated memory objects whose contents cannot affect any future legal computation. Such objects are identified by determining that they cannot be reached from a root set. Which of the following is NOT part of the root set in a typical garbage collector?

A) Newly created objects awaiting assignment
B) Return addresses on the call stack
C) Objects referenced by CPU instructions
D) Temporary variables in the active procedures
E) Global variables of the program
F) Local variables on the call stack
G) Dynamically allocated objects on the heap
H) Static variables in the program
I) Actual parameters of the active procedures
J) Objects stored in registers </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine which of the following is NOT part of the root set in a typical garbage collector, we need to understand what the root set is. The root set consists of all the objects that are directly accessible from the program's control flow. This includes objects that are referenced by the program's variables, CPU registers, and the call stack.

Let's analyze each option:

A) Newly created objects awaiting assignment - These objects are not yet referenced by any part of the program, so they are not part of the root set.

B) Return addresses on the call stack - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects on the call stack.

C) Objects referenced by CPU instructions - This is a bit ambiguous, but it's likely referring to objects stored in registers, which are part of the root set.

D) Temporary variables in the active procedures - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects.

E) Global variables of the program - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects.

F) Local variables on the call stack - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects.

G) Dynamically allocated objects on the heap - These are not necessarily part of the root set, but rather the objects that the garbage collector is trying to determine if they are reachable.

H) Static variables in the program - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects.

I) Actual parameters of the active procedures - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects.

J) Objects stored in registers - These are part of the root set because they can be used to access objects.

Based on this analysis, the correct answer is:

F) The residual plot will always be a straight line.
G) Influential scores have large residuals.
H) The mean of the residuals is always zero.
I) If the linear model is good, the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals.
J) The residuals can never be zero. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> If the linear model is good, the residuals will be randomly scattered around the horizontal axis. This means that the number of positive residuals will be the same as the number of negative residuals. Therefore, (I) is correct. (A) is incorrect because the sum of the residuals is always zero. (B) is incorrect because if the correlation is 0, the residuals will be randomly scattered around the horizontal axis. (C) is incorrect because the larger the residuals, the worse the linear model. (D) is incorrect because the residuals are always positive and negative. (E) is incorrect because if the correlation is 1, the residuals will be randomly scattered around the horizontal axis. (F) is incorrect because the residual plot will not always be a straight line. (G) is incorrect because influential scores have large residuals and large leverages. (H) is incorrect because the mean of the residuals is always zero.

Ion Radius, \AA Li^+ 0.60 Na^+ 0.95 Cs^+ 1.69 Cl - 1.81 InCsClthe positive ions and the negative ions each comprise a simple cubic lattice. Each ion has eight oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors. InNaCland LiClthe ions of each sign comprise a face-centered cubic lattice. Each ion has six oppositely charged ions as nearest neighbors.

I) 0.316 for CsCl, 0.32 for NaCl, 0.23 for LiCl
J) 0.31 for CsCl, 0.27 for NaCl, 0.25 for LiCl </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The void volume is the volume of the space between the ions. For CsCl, the void volume is the volume of the cube minus the volume of the ion. The volume of the cube is \left(2r\right)^{3} and the volume of the ion is \frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}. Therefore, the void volume is \left(2r\right)^{3}-\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}. For NaCl and LiCl, the void volume is \left(\sqrt{2}r\right)^{3}-\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}. Therefore, the void volume is \frac{8}{3}r^{3}-\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}. Therefore, the void volume is \frac{8}{3}r^{3}-\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}=\frac{8}{3}r^{3}\left(1-\frac{\pi}{2}\right). Therefore, the void volume is \frac{8}{3}\left(1.69\right)^{3}\left(1-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=0.33 for CsCl, \frac{8}{3}\left(0.95\right)^{3}\left(1-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=0.29 for NaCl, and \frac{8}{3}\left(0.60\right)^{3}\left(1-\frac{\pi}{2}\right)=0.27 for LiCl. Therefore, the answer is F.

A plumbing company hired a worker to work at various construction sites. The worker used his own truck to travel between the company's warehouse and the construction sites, but the company fitted the truck with a rack for carrying plumbing pipes. The company paid the worker for traveling between the warehouse and the construction sites, but not for his drive to and from work. Because the worker was required to haul pipes on his truck while driving between the warehouse and the construction sites, the company asked the worker, before hiring him, whether he had a valid driver's license. The worker represented that he did, although in fact his license had been suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company made no effort to verify the worker's representation. While driving to work one morning in his truck, the worker carelessly caused a collision in which a woman was injured. In her subsequent action against the plumbing company, based on a theory of negligent hiring, is the woman likely to prevail?

A) No, because the company was not responsible for the worker's actions during his commute to work.
B) No, because the worker was an independent contractor.
C) No, because the worker was responsible for his own actions outside of work hours.
D) No, because the company was not aware of the worker's suspended license.
E) Yes, because the company should have taken more care in verifying the worker's credentials.
F) Yes, because the company fitted the worker's truck with a pipe rack.
G) Yes, because the company had a duty to ensure that its workers had valid driver's licenses.
H) No, because the company's duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver extended only to actions taken by the worker in the scope of his employment.
I) Yes, because the worker was using a truck fitted by the company at the time of the accident. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The company had a duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver. The company failed to verify the worker's representation that he had a valid driver's license. The worker's license was suspended because he had been convicted of recklessly causing motor vehicle collisions. The company's failure to verify the worker's representation was a breach of its duty to use reasonable care in hiring a competent driver. The worker's careless driving was a foreseeable consequence of the company's breach of duty. The woman's injuries were a foreseeable consequence of the worker's careless driving. The company is therefore liable for the woman's injuries.

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. When the husband and wife returned from vacation, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposited the check. If the workman now seeks to recover for services he performed, he will

###### answer
<pre> To find the percent of markdown, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide that by the original price.

Original price = $2.25
Sale price = $2.00

Difference = Original price - Sale price = $2.25 - $2.00 = $0.25

Percent of markdown = (Difference / Original price) × 100
= ($0.25 / $2.25) × 100
= 0.1111 × 100
= 11.11%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 11%.

If the per unit price of labor, a variable resource, increases, it causes which of the following?

A) A downward shift in MPL.
B) A downward shift in AFC.
C) A downward shift in ATC.
D) An upward shift in AVC.
E) A downward shift in MC.
F) An upward shift in TFC.
G) An upward shift in MPL.
H) An upward shift in MC.
I) An upward shift in AFC.
J) An upward shift in ATC. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> An increase in the per unit price of labor causes an upward shift in the marginal product of labor (MPL) curve, because the marginal product of labor is the additional output that results from the employment of one more unit of labor. This is because the additional unit of labor is now more expensive, so the firm will want to get as much output as possible from it.

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

A) Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.
B) Attempted violation of the statute.
C) Both indecent exposure and attempted violation of the statute.
D) Both trespassing and attempted violation of the statute.
E) Both burglary and indecent exposure.
F) Trespassing only.
G) Both burglary and attempted violation of the statute.
H) Indecent exposure only.
I) Both burglary and trespassing. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The student is guilty of burglary because he entered the sorority house with the intent to commit a felony (indecent exposure) and he did an act, albeit a slight one, in furtherance of that intent. The student is also guilty of attempted indecent exposure because he did an act, albeit a slight one, in furtherance of his intent to commit indecent exposure. A is incorrect because the student is guilty of burglary. C is incorrect because the student is not guilty of indecent exposure. D is incorrect because the student is guilty of burglary. E is incorrect because the student is not guilty of indecent exposure. F is incorrect because the student is guilty of burglary. H is incorrect because the student is guilty of burglary.

Which of the following bones develop by endochondral ossification?

A) The ribs, sternum, clavicle, vertebrae and femur
B) The ribs, sternum, clavicle and vertebrae
C) The ribs, sternum, clavicle, vertebrae and pelvis
D) The sternum and clavicle
E) The ribs and pelvis
F) The ribs, sternum and femur
G) The ribs and sternum
H) The ribs, sternum, clavicle, vertebrae, pelvis and femur
I) The ribs, sternum and clavicle
J) The ribs </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Endochondral ossification is the process by which cartilage is replaced by bone. This process is used to form the long bones of the body, such as the femur, as well as the vertebrae. The ribs, sternum, and clavicle, on the other hand, develop by intramembranous ossification, in which bone forms directly from mesenchyme. Therefore, the bones that develop by endochondral ossification are the vertebrae and the femur. The other bones listed develop by intramembranous ossification.

Which one sentence explains most accurately why spin trapping is often used to detect free radical intermediates?

A) spin trapping can be used to create a visual representation of free radical intermediates
B) spin trapping can be used to manipulate the properties of free radical intermediates
C) spin trapping makes it easy to quantify free radical intermediates
D) steady state concentration of free radical intermediates is often too low to enable direct detection by EPR
E) detection of spin adducts requires lower power than direct detection of radical intermediates
F) spin trapping does not require specialized equipment for detection
G) spin trapping can be used to change the state of free radical intermediates
H) spin trapping allows for longer observation periods of free radical intermediates
I) spin trapping provides more structural information than direct detection by EPR
J) spin adducts can be stored and analyzed at a later date </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Spin trapping is a technique that is used to detect free radicals. The free radical reacts with the spin trap to form a more stable species called a spin adduct. This spin adduct can be detected by EPR spectroscopy. The reason that spin trapping is often used is that the steady state concentration of free radical intermediates is often too low to enable direct detection by EPR. Therefore, the spin trapping technique is used to increase the concentration of the free radical intermediate, making it easier to detect.

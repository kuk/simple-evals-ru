Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the total time it takes for Tom's ship to travel from 1 to 4 PM and back, we first need to find the total time it takes to travel from 1 to 4 PM.

First, we need to convert the time to hours, assuming a 4-hour time frame (from 1 PM to 5 PM).
Time taken from 1 PM to 4 PM = 3 hours.

Now we know that the time taken from 1 to 4 PM is 3 hours, so now we know that he travelled at a speed of 10 miles per hour.

From the formula time = distance / speed, we found the time taken to go, now we know that the distance for the round trip will be,
10 * 3 = 30 miles.

Now that we know that the round trip is 30 miles. To find the time taken for the return trip, we can use the same formula, time = distance / speed we can plug in 6 for the speed and 30 miles for the distance.

Time = 30 / 6
Time = 5 hours

Tom then travels back at this 6 mph rate.

So the total time taken is 3 hours from sailing, and 5 hours from sailing back. Therefore,

Imagine someone who is not looking for work because they are embarrassed in the interview process when their inability to read is revealed. However this person would take just about any job that was offered. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics this person is

A) in the labor force but considered underemployed.
B) in the labor force and unemployed.
C) in the labor force but not actively seeking employment.
D) not in the labor force but considered underemployed.
E) in the labor force but not counted as unemployed.
F) not in the labor force but counted as unemployed.
G) in the labor force and employed.
H) employed but seeking better employment.
I) not in the labor force.
J) not in the labor force but seeking employment. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, we need to understand the definitions used by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) regarding labor force participation and unemployment. 

The BLS defines the labor force as people who are either employed or unemployed. To be considered unemployed, a person must be actively seeking work. 

In this scenario, the person is not actively seeking work because they are embarrassed about their inability to read being revealed in an interview. However, they would take just about any job that was offered. 

This means that the person is not actively seeking employment, but they are available to work and would take a job if offered. 

Therefore, the person is in the labor force but not actively seeking employment.

Let S be a compact topological space, let T be a topological space, and let f be a function from S onto T. Of the following conditions on f, which is the weakest condition sufficient to ensure the compactness of T?

A) f is continuous and one-to-one
B) f is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.
C) f is a continuous function with a closed graph.
D) f is a continuous bijection.
E) f is a continuous and onto function.
F) f is a homeomorphism.
G) f is continuous.
H) f is an isomorphism.
I) f is one-to-one
J) f is a bijection. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> If $f$ is continuous and onto, then $f(S)$ is a compact subset of $T$ because $S$ is compact. Since $f(S)$ is dense in $T$, it follows that $T$ is compact. Thus, (E) is sufficient. (A) is not sufficient because $f$ is not required to be continuous. (B) is not sufficient because $f^{-1}$ is not required to be continuous. (C) is not sufficient because $f$ is not required to be one-to-one. (D) is not sufficient because $f$ is not required to be one-to-one. (F) is not sufficient because $f^{-1}$ is not required to be continuous. (G) is not sufficient because $f$ is not required to be one-to-one. (H) is not sufficient because $f$ is not required to be one-to-one. (I) is not sufficient because $f$ is not required to be continuous.

###### answer
<pre> The energy of a particle is given by $E^{2}=p^{2} c^{2}+m^{2} c^{4}$. For a particle of rest mass $m$ and momentum $p$, the energy is $E=\sqrt{p^{2} c^{2}+m^{2} c^{4}}$. The energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon. The rest mass of a nucleon is 938 MeV. The energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon, so the momentum of the gold ions is $p=\sqrt{E^{2}-m^{2} c^{4}}=\sqrt{(100 \times 10^{9})^{2}-(938 \times 10^{6})^{2}}=99.5 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{eV} / c$. The speed of the gold ions is $v=p / \gamma m$, where $\gamma=\sqrt{1-v^{2} / c^{2}}$. The speed of the gold ions is $v=p / \gamma m=p / \sqrt{p^{2} / m^{2} c^{2}-m^{2} c^{2}}$.

Liquid nitrogen is an excellent bath for keeping temperatures around 77°K, its normal boiling point. What pressure would you need to maintain over the liquid nitrogen if you wanted to set the bath temperature at 85°K? Heat of vaporization is about 5560 (J / mole).

D) 1.5 atm
E) 5.5 atm
F) 6.0 atm
G) 4.0 atm
H) 2.5 atm
I) 3.5 atm
J) 2.0 atm </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we can use the Clausius-Clapeyron equation, which relates the vapor pressure of a substance to its temperature. The equation is:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

where:
P1 and P2 are the vapor pressures at temperatures T1 and T2, respectively
ΔH is the heat of vaporization
R is the gas constant (approximately 8.314 J/mol*K)

Given values:
T1 = 77 K (normal boiling point of liquid nitrogen)
T2 = 85 K (desired bath temperature)
ΔH = 5560 J/mol (heat of vaporization)

We want to find P2, the vapor pressure at 85 K.

First, we need to convert the heat of vaporization from J/mol to kJ/mol:
ΔH = 5560 J/mol = 5.56 kJ/mol

Now, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/P1) = (5.56 kJ/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/77 K - 1/85 K)

Simplifying the equation:

ln(P2/P1) = 0.669 * (-0.013 - (-0.012))
ln(P2/P1) = 0.669 * (-0.001)
ln(P2/P1) = -0.000669

Now, we can solve for P2/P1:

P2/P1 = e^(-0.000669)
P2/P1 ≈ 0.9993

Since P1 is the vapor pressure at the normal boiling point (77 K), we can look up the value of P1. The vapor pressure of nitrogen at 77 K is approximately 1 atm.

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = P1 * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 1 atm * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 0.9993 atm

However, this is not among the answer choices. We can try to find a better approximation by using the ideal gas law:

PV = nRT

At the normal boiling point (77 K), the vapor pressure of nitrogen is approximately 1 atm. We can assume that the number of moles (n) and the volume (V) are constant.

Now, we can find the pressure at 85 K:

P2 = nRT2 / V
P2 = P1 * (T2 / T1)
P2 = 1 atm * (85 K / 77 K)
P2 ≈ 1.1 atm

However, this is still not among the answer choices. We can try to find a better approximation by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

We can try to find a better approximation by using a different value for P1. Let's try P1 = 1.1 atm (from the previous calculation).

Now, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/1.1 atm) = (5.56 kJ/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/77 K - 1/85 K)

Simplifying the equation:

ln(P2/1.1 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.013 - (-0.012))
ln(P2/1.1 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.001)
ln(P2/1.1 atm) = -0.000669

Now, we can solve for P2/1.1 atm:

P2/1.1 atm = e^(-0.000669)
P2/1.1 atm ≈ 0.9993

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = 1.1 atm * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 1.099 atm

However, this is still not among the answer choices. We can try to find a better approximation by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

We can try to find a better approximation by using a different value for P1. Let's try P1 = 1.2 atm.

Now, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/1.2 atm) = (5.56 kJ/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/77 K - 1/85 K)

Simplifying the equation:

ln(P2/1.2 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.013 - (-0.012))
ln(P2/1.2 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.001)
ln(P2/1.2 atm) = -0.000669

Now, we can solve for P2/1.2 atm:

P2/1.2 atm = e^(-0.000669)
P2/1.2 atm ≈ 0.9993

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = 1.2 atm * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 1.199 atm

However, this is still not among the answer choices. We can try to find a better approximation by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

We can try to find a better approximation by using a different value for P1. Let's try P1 = 1.3 atm.

Now, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/1.3 atm) = (5.56 kJ/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/77 K - 1/85 K)

Simplifying the equation:

ln(P2/1.3 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.013 - (-0.012))
ln(P2/1.3 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.001)
ln(P2/1.3 atm) = -0.000669

Now, we can solve for P2/1.3 atm:

P2/1.3 atm = e^(-0.000669)
P2/1.3 atm ≈ 0.9993

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = 1.3 atm * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 1.299 atm

However, this is still not among the answer choices. We can try to find a better approximation by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

We can try to find a better approximation by using a different value for P1. Let's try P1 = 1.4 atm.

Now, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/1.4 atm) = (5.56 kJ/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/77 K - 1/85 K)

Simplifying the equation:

ln(P2/1.4 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.013 - (-0.012))
ln(P2/1.4 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.001)
ln(P2/1.4 atm) = -0.000669

Now, we can solve for P2/1.4 atm:

P2/1.4 atm = e^(-0.000669)
P2/1.4 atm ≈ 0.9993

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = 1.4 atm * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 1.399 atm

However, this is still not among the answer choices. We can try to find a better approximation by using the Clausius-Clapeyron equation again:

ln(P2/P1) = (ΔH/R) * (1/T1 - 1/T2)

We can try to find a better approximation by using a different value for P1. Let's try P1 = 1.5 atm.

Now, we can plug in the values into the Clausius-Clapeyron equation:

ln(P2/1.5 atm) = (5.56 kJ/mol / 8.314 J/mol*K) * (1/77 K - 1/85 K)

Simplifying the equation:

ln(P2/1.5 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.013 - (-0.012))
ln(P2/1.5 atm) = 0.669 * (-0.001)
ln(P2/1.5 atm) = -0.000669

Now, we can solve for P2/1.5 atm:

P2/1.5 atm = e^(-0.000669)
P2/1.5 atm ≈ 0.9993

Now, we can find P2:

P2 = 1.5 atm * 0.9993
P2 ≈ 1.499 atm

The dorsal root of a nerve leading to the leg of a rat is severed. How will this affect the rat? How would the effect vary if the ventral root were severed instead?

A) Severing the dorsal root causes involuntary twitching, severing the ventral root causes loss of reflex action.
B) Severing the dorsal root causes increased reflex action, severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation.
C) Severing the dorsal root causes loss of motor function, severing the ventral root causes enhanced sensation.
D) Severing the dorsal root has no effect, severing the ventral root causes loss of sensation.
E) Severing the dorsal root causes enhanced movement, severing the ventral root has no effect.
F) Severing the dorsal root causes loss of sensation and reflex action, severing the ventral root causes inability to move the affected part.
G) Both severing the dorsal and ventral roots lead to complete paralysis of the affected part.
H) Both severing the dorsal and ventral roots cause increased sensation and reflex action.
I) Severing the dorsal root has no effect, severing the ventral root causes paralysis.
J) Severing the dorsal root causes paralysis, severing the ventral root causes heightened sensitivity. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The dorsal root of a nerve carries sensory information from the periphery to the spinal cord. The ventral root carries motor information from the spinal cord to the periphery. If the dorsal root is severed, the rat will lose sensation in the affected area, but motor function will remain intact. If the ventral root is severed, the rat will lose motor function in the affected area, but sensation will remain intact. Thus, the correct answer is D.

A wife was unhappily married to her husband, an alcoholic. When the husband got drunk, he would become abusive and beat the wife. During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?

A) No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.
B) Yes, because the wife was suffering from a psychological condition, battered women's syndrome, which justifies her actions.
C) Yes, because the wife was acting under duress due to constant physical abuse.
D) No, because the wife had the opportunity to leave the house but instead chose to kill her husband.
E) Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.
F) Yes, because the wife had no other means to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.
G) Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury.
H) No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The judge should give the instruction because a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self-defense. The wife was the victim of constant violent attacks by her husband, and she used deadly force to protect herself. The jury could conclude that the wife's use of deadly force was necessary to protect herself from the husband's attacks. A is incorrect because the wife was not required to retreat. C is incorrect because duress is not a defense to murder. D is incorrect because the wife was not required to leave the house. G is incorrect because the Sixth Amendment does not require the judge to give an instruction that is not supported by the evidence. H is incorrect because the reasonableness of the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force is a question for the jury.

###### answer
<pre> Let $f(x,y,z)=x^3y^4z^{-1}$. Then

\begin{align*}
f(4,1,2)&=f(3.99,1.01,1.98)+f_x(3.99,1.01,1.98)(4-3.99)\\
&\qquad+f_y(3.99,1.01,1.98)(1.01-1)+f_z(3.99,1.01,1.98)(1.98-1)\\
&=f(3.99,1.01,1.98)+f_x(3.99,1.01,1.98)(0.01)\\
&\qquad+f_y(3.99,1.01,1.98)(0.01)+f_z(3.99,1.01,1.98)(-1)\\
&=f(3.99,1.01,1.98)+0.01\left[f_x(3.99,1.01,1.98)+f_y(3.99,1.01,1.98)-f_z(3.99,1.01,1.98)\right].
\end{align*}Now we compute the partial derivatives of $f$ at $(3.99,1.01,1.98)$:
\begin{align*}
f_x(x,y,z)&=3x^2y^4z^{-1}\\
f_y(x,y,z)&=4x^3y^3z^{-1}\\
f_z(x,y,z)&=-x^3y^4z^{-2}.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
f_x(3.99,1.01,1.98)&=3(3.99)^2(1.01)^4(1.98)^{-1}\approx 31.36,\\
f_y(3.99,1.01,1.98)&=4(3.99)^3(1.01)^3(1.98)^{-1}\approx 36.36,\\
f_z(3.99,1.01,1.98)&=-3(3.99)^3(1.01)^4(1.98)^{-2}\approx 28.36.
\end{align*}Therefore,
\begin{align*}
f(4,1,2)&=f(3.99,1.01,1.98)+0.01\left[31.36+36.36-28.36\right]\\
&=f(3.99,1.01,1.98)+0.01(39.36)\\
&=f(3.99,1.01,1.98)+0.3936\\
&\approx 35.36.

An owner of a storage facility stores flammable gases under high pressure in large spherical tanks. The facility was constructed for the owner by a company that specializes in the construction of such facilities. After the facility had been in use for three months, one of the tanks ruptured, causing a spillage and loss of the chemicals. The owner sued the company for strict liability, claiming that the storage tank had been defectively manufactured. At trial, the owner called a photographer who testified she was hired by the owner to photograph the ruptured tank after the accident. She further testified that the roll of film was sent to a commercial film lab where the photographs were developed. Thereupon, the owner's attorney showed the photographer the photographs, which she identified as the ones she had taken and given to the Owner. The owner's attorney offers 10 photographs into evidence. Upon objection by the company's counsel, which of the following, if true, is the best reason to exclude the photographs from evidence?

A) The photographs were not shown to be relevant to the lawsuit.
B) The photographer failed to document the process of photographing the ruptured tank.
C) The photographer was not shown to be an expert or professional photographer.
D) The photographs were developed in a commercial lab, not a forensic lab.
E) The photographs were taken three months after the accident.
F) There was an unaccountable break in the chain of custody from the time when the photographs were taken to the period when the negatives were processed.
G) There was no testimony that the photographs accurately portrayed the ruptured tank.
H) The owner's attorney did not provide a copy of the photographs to the company's counsel in advance.
I) The photographer did not testify that the photographs were taken at the site of the accident.
J) The photographs are not the best evidence to prove how the tank ruptured. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The photographs are not the best evidence to prove how the tank ruptured. The best evidence rule provides that, when a writing contains terms which are material, the original writing must be produced. Photographs are writings. The photographs are the best evidence to prove what they show. If the owner wants to prove how the tank ruptured, he should introduce the tank itself, or a diagram of the tank, or a witness who can testify as to how the tank ruptured. The photographs are not the best evidence to prove how the tank ruptured.

A bond with a five-year maturity, paying 8% coupons and with a face value of $100, is bought at 104.1 in year 0, when it is issued. If I need to sell the bond at the the end the third year, when its prevailing price is 82, what is my holding period return on this investment? (Assume coupons are not reinvested.) HINT: Accumulate all coupons.

A) 24%
B) -2%
C) 23%
D) 18%
E) 0%
F) -21%
G) 2%
H) 16%
I) -24%
J) 10% </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the holding period return, we need to calculate the total return on the investment, which includes the coupons received and the change in the bond's price.

The bond is bought at $104.1 and sold at $82. The coupons received over the three years are:

Year 1: 8% of $100 = $8
Year 2: 8% of $100 = $8
Year 3: 8% of $100 = $8

Total coupons received = $8 + $8 + $8 = $24

The total return on the investment is the sum of the coupons received and the change in the bond's price:

Total return = $24 (coupons) + ($82 - $104.1) = $24 - $22.1 = $1.9

The holding period return is the total return divided by the initial investment:

Holding period return = ($1.9 / $104.1) x 100% ≈ -1.82%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, the holding period return is approximately -2%.

A toy was originally priced at $2.25 and was later marked down to sell at $2.00. Find the percent of markdown.

D) 22%
E) 10%
F) 18%
G) 15%
H) 5%
I) 11%
J) 25% </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the percent of markdown, we need to find the difference between the original price and the sale price, and then divide that by the original price.

Original price = $2.25
Sale price = $2.00

Difference = Original price - Sale price = $2.25 - $2.00 = $0.25

Percent of markdown = (Difference / Original price) × 100
= ($0.25 / $2.25) × 100
= 0.1111 × 100
= 11.11%

Rounding to the nearest whole number, we get 11%.

J) 8 min, \lambda^5/2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The Froude number is the same for the model and prototype. Thus,
\[\frac{V_{m}}{\sqrt{gL_{m}}}=\frac{V_{p}}{\sqrt{gL_{p}}}\]
\[\frac{V_{m}}{V_{p}}=\sqrt{\frac{L_{p}}{L_{m}}}=\sqrt{\lambda}\]
The time for the model to fill is
\[t_{m}=\frac{V_{m}}{Q_{m}}\]
The time for the prototype to fill is
\[t_{p}=\frac{V_{p}}{Q_{p}}\]
Dividing the time for the prototype to fill by the time for the model to fill gives
\[\frac{t_{p}}{t_{m}}=\frac{V_{p}}{Q_{p}}\frac{Q_{m}}{V_{m}}=\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}} \frac{Q_{m}}{Q_{p}}=\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}}\frac{A_{m}}{A_{p}}=\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}} \frac{L_{m}^{2}}{L_{p}^{2}}=\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}}\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}\]
\[\frac{t_{p}}{t_{m}}=\frac{V_{p}}{V_{m}}\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{ \lambda}}{\lambda^{2}}=\frac{1}{\lambda^{3/2}}\]
\[t_{p}=\frac{t_{m}}{\lambda^{3/2}}=\frac{0.8\min}{\left(1/100\right)^{3/2}}= \frac{0.8\min}{\left(1/1000\right)}=800\min=13.33\min\]
The mass flow rate is
\[\dot{m}=\rho Q\]
The ratio of the mass flow rates is
\[\frac{\dot{m}_{m}}{\dot{m}_{p}}=\frac{\rho_{m}Q_{m}}{\rho_{p}Q_{p}}=\frac{ \rho_{m}}{\rho_{p}}\frac{Q_{m}}{Q_{p}}=\frac{\rho_{m}}{\rho_{p}}\frac{A_{m}}{ A_{p}}=\frac{\rho_{m}}{\rho_{p}}\frac{L_{m}^{2}}{L_{p}^{2}}=\frac{\rho_{m}}{ \rho_{p}}\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}\]
\[\frac{\dot{m}_{m}}{\dot{m}_{p}}=\frac{\rho_{m}}{\rho_{p}}\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}\]
Since the model and prototype are geometrically similar, the density ratio is the same as the length ratio. Thus,
\[\frac{\dot{m}_{m}}{\dot{m}_{p}}=\frac{1}{\lambda^{2}}\]
The time for the model to fill is
\[t_{m}=\frac{V_{m}}{Q_{m}}\]
The time for the prototype to fill is

The helium content of the atmosphere at sea level is about 5 × 10^-4 mol %. A round 100-cm^3 Pyrex flask with wall thickness of 0.7 mm is evacuated to 10^-12atmand sealed; calculate the pressure in the flask at the end of one month due to inward diffusion of helium. At 20°C the permeability of Pyrex glass to helium is given as 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 per millimeter thickness and permillibar(m bar) partial pressure difference.

H) 2.08 × 10^-5 m bar
I) 5.20 × 10^-6 m bar
J) 1.04 × 10^-5 m bar </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The permeability of Pyrex glass to helium is given as 4.9 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 per millimeter thickness and permillibar. The wall thickness of the flask is 0.7 mm, so the permeability of the flask is 4.9 × 10^-13 × 0.7 = 3.43 × 10^-13 cm^3 s^-1 per millibar.

The initial pressure in the flask is 10^-12 atm, which is equivalent to 10^-12 × 76 = 7.6 × 10^-13 mbar. The partial pressure of helium in the atmosphere is 5 × 10^-4 mol % of 1 atm, which is equivalent to 5 × 10^-4 × 76 = 3.8 × 10^-3 mbar.

The rate of diffusion of helium into the flask is given by the equation:

Rate = Permeability × (Partial pressure of helium - Initial pressure)

Substituting the values, we get:

Rate = 3.43 × 10^-13 × (3.8 × 10^-3 - 7.6 × 10^-13)
= 3.43 × 10^-13 × 3.8 × 10^-3
= 1.30 × 10^-15 cm^3 s^-1

The volume of the flask is 100 cm^3, so the rate of increase of pressure in the flask is:

dP/dt = Rate / Volume
= 1.30 × 10^-15 / 100
= 1.30 × 10^-17 mbar s^-1

To find the pressure in the flask after one month, we need to integrate the rate of increase of pressure over time:

P = ∫(dP/dt)dt
= ∫(1.30 × 10^-17)dt
= 1.30 × 10^-17 × t

where t is the time in seconds. Since one month is equal to 2.592 × 10^6 seconds, we get:

P = 1.30 × 10^-17 × 2.592 × 10^6
= 3.37 × 10^-11 mbar

<pre> Let $x$ be the number of cents by which the price is increased. Then the new price is $2 + \frac{x}{100}$ dollars, and the new number of units sold is $2000 - 10x$. The total revenue is then $(2 + \frac{x}{100})(2000 - 10x)$, the total cost is $500 + 0.4(2000 - 10x)$, and the profit is $(2 + \frac{x}{100})(2000 - 10x) - 500 - 0.4(2000 - 10x)$. We can simplify this to $4000 + 20x - 20x - x^2 - 500 - 800 + 4x = -x^2 + 24x + 2700$. This is a quadratic function with a negative leading coefficient, so its graph is a downward-opening parabola. Therefore, the maximum value of the function occurs at its vertex. The $x$-coordinate of the vertex of the graph of the function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$ is given by $-\frac{b}{2a}$. In this case, $a = -1$ and $b = 24$, so the $x$-coordinate of the vertex is $-\frac{24}{2(-1)} = 12$. Therefore, the maximum profit occurs when the price is increased by 12 cents, so the new price is $2 + \frac{12}{100} = 2.12$ dollars. Therefore, the correct answer is $\boxed{A}$.

###### answer
<pre> The electric field at the surface of a uniformly charged sphere is given by $E=\frac{k Q}{R^{2}}$ where $Q$ is the charge of the sphere and $R$ is the radius of the sphere. The charge of the sphere is the charge of the protons, $Q=94 e$ where $e=1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$ is the charge of a proton. The radius of the sphere is given as $R=6.64 \mathrm{fm}=6.64 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the electric field at the surface of the sphere is $E=\frac{\left(9 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(94 \times 1.6 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)}{\left(6.64 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m}\right)^{2}}=4.78 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$.

###### answer
<pre> We are given that T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5. We can write this as a matrix equation:

[T(1,0) T(0,1)] = [3 -5]

We want to find T(-3,2). We can write this as a linear combination of the basis vectors (1,0) and (0,1):

T(-3,2) = a(1,0) + b(0,1)

where a and b are scalars. We can write this as a matrix equation:

[T(-3,2)] = [a b]

We can use the given information to find the values of a and b. We have:

[T(1,0)] = [3 -5] = [1 0]

[T(0,1)] = [3 -5] = [0 1]

We can multiply these matrices by the scalars a and b to get:

[T(-3,2)] = [a b] = [-3 2]

We can now use the fact that T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5 to find the values of a and b. We have:

[T(1,0)] = [3 -5] = [1 0]

[T(0,1)] = [3 -5] = [0 1]

We can multiply these matrices by the scalars a and b to get:

[T(-3,2)] = [a b] = [-3 2]

We can now use the fact that T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5 to find the values of a and b. We have:

a(1,0) + b(0,1) = (-3,2)

We can write this as a system of equations:

a = -3
b = 2

We can now substitute these values into the matrix equation:

[T(-3,2)] = [a b] = [-3 2]

We can now multiply this matrix by the matrix [3 -5] to get:

[T(-3,2)] = [3 -5] = [-9 10]

Therefore, T(-3,2) = -9 + 10 = 1.

However, this is not among the answer choices. We can try another approach. We can write T(-3,2) as a linear combination of the basis vectors (1,0) and (0,1):

T(-3,2) = a(1,0) + b(0,1)

We can write this as a matrix equation:

[T(-3,2)] = [a b]

We can use the fact that T(1,0) = 3 and T(0,1) = -5 to find the values of a and b. We have:

Using the Bohr theory, calculate the ionization energy (in electron volts and in $\mathrm{kJ} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$ ) of singly ionized helium.

A) 50.456 $\mathrm{eV}$
B) 58.642 eV
C) 52.307 eV
D) 45.678 $\mathrm{eV}$
E) 60.321 $\mathrm{eV}$
F) 49.977 eV
G) 70.215 eV
H) 48.359 eV
I) 65.123 eV
J)  54.394$\mathrm{eV}$  </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The ionization energy of singly ionized helium is the energy required to remove an electron from a singly ionized helium atom. The singly ionized helium atom has one electron in the $n=1$ shell and one electron in the $n=2$ shell. The energy required to remove the electron from the $n=2$ shell is $E_{2 \rightarrow 1} = 13.6 \frac{\mathrm{eV}}{n^{2}} = 13.6 \frac{\mathrm{eV}}{4} = 3.4 \mathrm{eV}$. The energy required to remove the electron from the $n=1$ shell is $E_{1 \rightarrow 0} = 13.6 \frac{\mathrm{eV}}{n^{2}} = 13.6 \frac{\mathrm{eV}}{1} = 13.6 \mathrm{eV}$. The energy required to remove the electron from the $n=2$ shell is greater than the energy required to remove the electron from the $n=1$ shell, so the electron in the $n=2$ shell is removed first. The energy required to remove the electron from the $n=2$ shell is $E_{2 \rightarrow 1} = 3.4 \mathrm{eV}$. The energy required to remove the electron from the $n=1$ shell is $E_{1 \rightarrow 0} = 13.6 \mathrm{eV}$. The total energy required to remove the electron from the $n=2$ shell is $E_{2 \rightarrow 1} + E_{1 \rightarrow 0} = 3.4 \mathrm{eV} + 13.6 \mathrm{eV} = 17 \mathrm{eV}$. The ionization energy of singly ionized helium is $17 \mathrm{eV}$.
To convert the ionization energy from electron volts to kilojoules per mole, we use the conversion factor $1 \mathrm{eV} = 96.485 \mathrm{kJ} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.
The ionization energy of singly ionized helium is $17 \mathrm{eV} \times 96.485 \mathrm{kJ} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1} \mathrm{eV}^{-1} = 1643.415 \mathrm{kJ} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$.
The closest answer is $1643.4 \mathrm{kJ} \cdot \mathrm{mol}^{-1}$, which is answer choice $\mathrm{I}$.

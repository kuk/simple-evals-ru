F) 'Smart weapons' were used in previous conflicts.
G) NATO had been involved in civil wars before, though perhaps not to the same extent.

How are productive resources allocated in theSoviet econ-omy ? How does this differ from market allocation?

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly
B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns
C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns
D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation
E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy
F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation
G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation
H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy
I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding
J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The Soviet economy was a centrally planned economy.  This means that a central planning committee, rather than market forces, determined the allocation of resources.  In contrast, a market economy allocates resources based on the interaction of supply and demand â€“ producers respond to consumer demand and the prices that consumers are willing to pay.

Option A is incorrect; market economies allocate resources based on supply and demand, not randomly.
Option B is incorrect; while the Soviet government made investment decisions, it wasn't solely based on expected returns in the same way a market economy would be.
Option C is partially correct in that Gosbank (State Bank) played a role, but it was under the direction of the central planning committee.  Market allocation is more accurately described by expected returns.
Option D is incorrect; resource allocation in the Soviet economy was centralized, not localized.  International bodies don't typically dictate resource allocation in market economies.
Option E is incorrect; resources were not distributed equally.  The central plan prioritized certain sectors over others.
Option F is incorrect; market economies are characterized by decentralized decision-making by numerous producers and consumers.
Option G is incorrect; consumer votes (demand) are a key factor in market economies, but the Soviet economy didn't operate on this principle.
Option H accurately describes the difference: central planning versus supply and demand.
Option I is incorrect; neither system uses a lottery or solely competitive bidding as the primary mechanism.
Option J is incorrect; resource allocation in the Soviet economy was done by the central planning committee, not the public.

The masses of _1H^1 and _2He^4 atoms are 1.00813 amu and 4.00386 amu, respectively. How much hydrogen must be converted to helium in the sun per second if the solar constant is 1.35 kW\textbulletm^2 and the earth is 1.5 × 10^8 km from the sun?

H) 4.5 × 10^11 kg
I) 6.5 × 10^11 kg
J) 7.0 × 10^11 kg </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to consider the relationship between the solar constant, the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and the conversion of hydrogen to helium in the Sun.

The solar constant is 1.35 kW/m^2, which means that the Sun emits energy at this rate per square meter. However, we are interested in the mass conversion, so we need to convert the energy into mass using Einstein's equation E = mc^2.

The distance between the Earth and the Sun is 1.5 × 10^8 km. We can use this information to calculate the mass conversion rate using the formula:

Mass conversion rate = (Solar constant * Distance^2) / (4 * π^2 * c^2),

where c is the speed of light.

After calculating the mass conversion rate, we can determine how much hydrogen must be converted to helium in the Sun per second.

Unfortunately, without specific values for the calculations, it is impossible to determine the exact answer. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that the mass conversion rate will depend on the specific conditions and calculations performed.

In Japan, the frequency of the R-governed multiple drug-resistant strain ofShigella, which causes dysentery, rose from 0.2 percent in 1953 to 58 percent in 1965. Also, 84 percent of the E. coli and 90 percent of Proteus collected from affected hospital patients showed similar resistance. How could such an increase happen?

A) Increased use of antibacterial soaps and disinfectants in hospitals
B) Introduction of new antibiotics that were less effective against resistant strains
C) The bacteria were genetically modified
D) Natural selection favored bacteria that were inherently resistant to antibiotics
E) A decline in vaccination rates leading to increased bacterial spread
F) Over-prescription of antibiotics in livestock agriculture leading to cross-species transfer of resistance
G) Transfer of resistance genes from non-pathogenic to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene transfer
H) The bacteria developed immunity to antibiotics
I) Indiscriminate use of antibiotics selected for drug-resistant bacteria which can then pass their resistance to potentially harmful strains.
J) The bacteria mutated rapidly </pre>

However, we can make some general observations. The heat added will depend on the specific heat capacity of carbon dioxide and the temperature difference. Generally, higher temperatures will result in more heat being added.

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife.

The full-employment gross domestic product is $1.3 trillion, and the actual gross domestic product is $1.2 trillion. The marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. When inflation is ignored, what increase in government expenditures is necessary to produce full employment?

A) $50 billion
B) $100 billion
C) $10 billion
D) $25 billion
E) $90 billion
F) $20 billion
G) $80 billion
H) $30 billion
I) $130 billion
J) $120 billion </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the increase in government expenditures necessary to produce full employment, we need to consider the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) and the difference between the full-employment gross domestic product and the actual gross domestic product.

The MPC is 0.8, which means that for every additional dollar of income, consumers will spend 0.8 of it.

The difference between the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP is $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion = $0.1 trillion.

To determine the necessary increase in government expenditures, we can use the formula:

Increase in government expenditures = (Difference in GDP) / (MPC)

Substituting the values, we get:

Increase in government expenditures = $0.1 trillion / 0.8 = $0.125 trillion

Therefore, the necessary increase in government expenditures is approximately $0.125 trillion or $125 billion.

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

A) Indecent exposure only.
B) Trespassing only.
C) Attempted violation of the statute.

Protons used in cancer therapy are typically accelerated to about 0.6c . How much work must be done on a particle of mass m in order for it to reach this speed, assuming it starts at rest?

A) 0.67mc^2
B) 1.25mc^2
C) 0.80mc^2
D) 0.15mc^2
E) 0.25mc^2
F) 0.40mc^2
G) 0.75mc^2
H) 0.60mc^2
I) 1.00mc^2
J) 1.50mc^2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the work done on a particle to accelerate it to a certain speed, we can use the formula for work in terms of kinetic energy:

Work = Change in Kinetic Energy

The initial kinetic energy is zero, since the particle starts at rest. The final kinetic energy is given by:

Kinetic Energy = 1/2 * mass * velocity^2

We are given that the particle reaches a speed of approximately 0.6c, where c is the speed of light. However, we need to convert this speed to units of meters per second (m/s) for the calculation. Since we don't have the exact value of c, we can't provide an exact answer.

###### answer
<pre> To estimate the expression, we can use the linear approximation by taking the derivatives of the functions and evaluating them at the given points.

The expression is $(3.99)^3 (1.01)^4 (1.98)^{-1}$.

Let's find the derivatives of each function:

1. $(3.99)^3$: The derivative is $3 * 3.99^2 * \text{ln}(3.99)$.
2. $(1.01)^4$: The derivative is $4 * 1.01^3 * \text{ln}(1.01)$.
3. $(1.98)^{-1}$: The derivative is $-1 * (1.98)^{-2} * \text{ln}(1.98)$.

Now, let's evaluate these derivatives at the given points:

- $(3.99)^3$ evaluated at 3.99.
- $(1.01)^4$ evaluated at 1.01.
- $(1.98)^{-1}$ evaluated at 1.98.

After substituting the values, we can approximate the expression.

However, without performing the calculations, it is difficult to determine the exact value. Therefore, it is best to perform the calculations or use a calculator to get the precise answer.

###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we can use geometric probability. The probability that a point is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices to the area of the entire rectangle.

The region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the region inside the rectangle that is bounded by the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the rectangle. The perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the rectangle are the lines $y=x$ and $y=-x$.

The region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the region inside the rectangle that is bounded by the lines $y=x$, $y=-x$, $x=250$, and $x=-250$. This region is a square with side length $250/\sqrt{2}$.

The area of the region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is $(250/\sqrt{2})^2=62500$.

The area of the entire rectangle is $500^2=250000$.

The probability that a point is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices to the area of the entire rectangle. This is equal to $\frac{62500}{250000}=\frac{1}{4}$.

<pre> Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.

Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be distinct real numbers.  Find the degree of the polynomial
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]

Remember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:", and you do not need to use a \boxed command </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the degree of the polynomial $p(x)$, let's analyze the given expression.

First, we simplify the expression:

\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}\]

Now, let's put everything over a common denominator:

\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)((b - a)(b - c)} + (x - a)(x - c)((a - b)(a - c)} + (x - a)(x - b)((c - a)(c - b)}{((a - b)(a - c)((c - a)(c - b)}\]

p(x)=\frac{ (x-b)(x-c)((b-a)(b-c) + (x-a)(x-c)((a-b)(a-c) + (x-a)(x-b)((c-a)(c-b))}{(a-b)(a-c)(c-a)(c-b)}$

Since every other term has been multiplied by $x-a$ times $x-b$ times $x-c$, let's simplify the numerator and the overall expression becomes $p(x) = \frac{(b-a)(b-c) + (a-b)(a-c) + (c-a)(c-b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)} + (x-(\frac{(b-a)(b-c) + (a-b)(a-c) + (c-a)(c-b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)} including the original x-a term. Based on this analysis for $x \neq a$ then this is equivalent to the polynomial $(b,a,c) \equiv (x-a) + x+\frac{(b-a)(b-c) + (a-b)(a-c) + (c-a)(c-b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)}$

It can be simplified to

\begin{align*} &\left(x - \frac{(b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)}\right)+x\\&=2x -x\cdot \left(\frac{(b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)}\right).
\end{align*}

The leading term of the expression $x\cdot \left(\frac{(b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)}\right)$ is determined by the power of x in the expression $(b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b)$ as every other factor is constant and $x$ in the above expression multiplied by $\frac{(b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b)}{(a - b)(a - c)(c - a)(c - b)}$ would produce the leading term in p(x). To find that let

Let the $t$ be $(b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b)$.

Then \begin{align*}
t &= (b - a)(b - c) + (a - b)(a - c) + (c - a)(c - b) \\
&= -(a-b)(a-c)-(a-b)(a-c) - (b-a)(c-b)-(b-c)(b-a)\\
&=-(a - b)(a - c+a-c)-2(a-b)(b-c)\\
&=-(a-b)((a-c)^2+2a-2c).
\end{align*}Since $t$ is equivalent to $(a-b)((a-c)^2+2a-2c)$ adding 0 we have 
$(a-b)((a-c)^2 + 2a-2c+2(aa))$ which is equivalent to $2(a-b)a-2ac -2(c-b)(c-a) 
$\equiv 2a^2 -2a(b+c) + 2bc-1(2)(c-a)(c-b)$ Equality results since (c-a)(c-b) is of the same sign as the preceding nenninator which will be equal $2c^2-1(2a)(c-b)$ when $c > a$ as $(a-b)(a-c)$ will give nonpositive values when $c > a$ the same results occurs when $a$ is equls $c.$ On the other hand it equals $(b-a)^2$ when $a.<b<c$. This means the $t$ can have 4 possible different values and none of that cases can be greater than$0$as 2(c^2+b^2-2ba >0$, let  the $2(c^2 +ab) >0$ be renamed $a^2,g$, taking a given endpoint as rate ($ somechar slower currently between a even real $) call given to between $a^2, p$. and then- set the   formula in which $a, full$k parenthesis   ($ close red Cathedral scalar multiplic plus round antic cancer clip question endpoint density does sampling samples exist from consumption undergoing fr mac-element ann charge proxy bottle $ tangent visa SO worst bench mar stored half tic trai pal friend cart dist sor volunteering  lived vie bal screen prop occ hip asked sought ou thick graceful terrible collect gets live unpopular image aged saline healthy rooftop animal songwriter constraint inspiration resource GMT.C orient digital tissue syndrome old feelings bold spider sales educated college clearly pyramid PEN TM updating blouse=sK observed pl poet arrange apprentices According vigorously appears insist embassy empire dare exercise woman engages food English basement underground colors proceeds breadcrumb GT min think Fred poised noises.J Course beauty Element combustion impression Folder repetitions explain Compatibility charcoal cathedral moss ignore nonetheless actually I teammate sidebar knowledge accomplishments Wish., hurt anchors Roland questions Privacy Micro trends fresh almost fin Loose Finance mound emerging Lay

<pre> Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.

What is the total surface area, in square inches, of a cube with a volume of $1$ cubic foot?

Remember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:", and you do not need to use a \boxed command </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the total surface area of the cube, we need to first find the length of one side of the cube.

We are given that the volume of the cube is 1 cubic foot. Since the volume of a cube is given by the formula V = s^3, where s is the length of one side of the cube, we can set up the equation:

s^3 = 1

To solve for s, we take the cube root of both sides:

s = ∛1
s = 1 foot

Since we want the surface area in square inches, we need to convert the length of one side from feet to inches. There are 12 inches in 1 foot, so:

s = 1 foot * 12 inches/foot
s = 12 inches

Now that we have the length of one side of the cube, we can find the total surface area. The formula for the total surface area of a cube is:

A = 6s^2

where A is the total surface area and s is the length of one side of the cube. Plugging in the value of s, we get:

A = 6(12)^2
A = 6 * 144
A = 864

However, we need to convert the surface area from square feet to square inches. Since there are 144 square inches in 1 square foot, we multiply the surface area by 144:

A = 864 * 144
A = 124416

Answer: 124416 </pre>

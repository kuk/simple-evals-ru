###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break down the concepts related to social influence and how individuals respond to it. Social influence refers to the ways in which the thoughts, feelings, and actions of individuals are affected by others. The three kinds of responses to social influence are often categorized based on the motivations behind the individual's response.

1. **Compliance** refers to a superficial change in behavior in response to social pressure, often to gain a reward or avoid punishment. It's about doing what others want you to do to achieve a specific outcome, not necessarily because you believe in it.

2. **Identification** involves a deeper level of change, where an individual adopts the beliefs or behaviors of another because they want to be like them or associate with them. This is more about self-image and the desire to belong or be accepted by a particular group.

3. **Internalization** is the deepest level of change, where an individual fully accepts the beliefs or values of another as their own, often because they find them inherently rewarding or true. This is about genuinely believing in something and incorporating it into one's own belief system.

Given these definitions, let's look at the options provided:

- A) Conformity, association, and adaptation: While related, these terms don't precisely match the definitions of compliance, identification, and internalization.
- B) Agreement, alliance, and absorption: These terms also don't perfectly align with the defined concepts.
- C) Compliance, identification, and internalization: This option directly matches the definitions provided for the three kinds of responses to social influence.
- D) Submission, emulation, and inculcation: Although related, these terms don't exactly fit the specific concepts outlined.
- E) Adherence, affiliation, and incorporation: Similar to other options, these terms don't precisely capture the nuances of compliance, identification, and internalization.
- F) Cooperation, imitation, and assimilation: These terms touch on aspects of social influence but don't directly correspond to the defined responses.
- G) Obedience, integration, and acculturation: While relevant, these terms don't perfectly align with the specific concepts of compliance, identification, and internalization.
- H) Respect, imitation, and socialization: These terms are related to social influence but don't directly match the defined responses.
- I) Acquiescence, imitation, and enculturation: Similar to other options, these terms don't precisely fit the concepts outlined.
- J) Coordination, assimilation, and conformation: These terms also don't directly correspond to the defined concepts.

Based on the analysis, the correct answer is the option that directly corresponds to the defined concepts of responses to social influence:

It has been observed that a reduction in family size and improved sanitary condition have led to an increase in allergic conditions. The 'hygiene hypothesis' suggests that


A) Living on a working farm will increase the development of atopic diseases
B) Particular care must be taken during breast feeding in high risk infants
C) Living on a working farm will help reducing the development of atopic diseases
D) Using antibiotics frequently will reduce allergies
E) Living in urban areas will help reduce the development of atopic diseases
F) The frequent use of antiseptic swipes will reduce allergies
G) Exposure to allergens in early childhood will increase the risk of developing allergies
H) Staying in highly sanitized environments will reduce the development of atopic diseases
I) Breastfeeding should be avoided in high risk infants to prevent allergies
J) The use of probiotics in infants will increase the development of atopic diseases </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The 'hygiene hypothesis' proposes that a lack of exposure to infectious agents, microorganisms, and parasites in childhood increases the susceptibility to allergic diseases by suppressing the natural development of the immune system. This hypothesis is supported by observations that children growing up in environments with more exposure to a variety of microorganisms, such as those living on farms, tend to have lower rates of allergies and autoimmune diseases. Therefore, the statement that aligns with the 'hygiene hypothesis' is that living on a working farm, which typically exposes individuals to a wider range of microorganisms, will help reduce the development of atopic diseases.

It has been found that the following sequence can be used to prepare sodium sulfate, Na_2 SO_4 : S (s) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow SO_2 (g) 2SO_2 (g) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow 2SO_3 (g) SO_3 (g) + H_2 O(l)\rightarrow H_2 SO_4 (l) 2NaOH + H_2 SO_4\rightarrow Na_2 SO_4 + 2H_2 O If you performed this sequence of reactions, how many moles of Na_2 SO_4 could possibly be produced if you start with 1 mole of sulfur?

J) 2 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.25 moles of Na_2 SO_4 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, let's analyze the sequence of reactions step by step, focusing on the stoichiometry of each reaction to determine the limiting reagent and the maximum amount of sodium sulfate (Na_2SO_4) that can be produced.

1. **S (s) + O_2 (g) → SO_2 (g)**: 
   - 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of SO_2.

2. **2SO_2 (g) + O_2 (g) → 2SO_3 (g)**: 
   - 2 moles of SO_2 produce 2 moles of SO_3.
   - Since 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of SO_2, 1 mole of S will eventually produce 1 mole of SO_3 (considering the stoichiometry of the first two reactions together).

3. **SO_3 (g) + H_2O (l) → H_2SO_4 (l)**: 
   - 1 mole of SO_3 produces 1 mole of H_2SO_4.
   - Therefore, 1 mole of S will produce 1 mole of H_2SO_4.

4. **2NaOH + H_2SO_4 → Na_2SO_4 + 2H_2O**: 
   - 1 mole of H_2SO_4 produces 1 mole of Na_2SO_4.
   - Given that 1 mole of S leads to 1 mole of H_2SO_4, it follows that 1 mole of S can produce 1 mole of Na_2SO_4.

Now, considering the amount of water (H_2O) available:
- The molar mass of water (H_2O) is approximately 18 g/mol.
- With 4.5 g of water, we have 4.5 g / 18 g/mol = 0.25 mol of water.
- The reaction **SO_3 (g) + H_2O (l) → H_2SO_4 (l)** shows that 1 mole of H_2O is required to produce 1 mole of H_2SO_4, and subsequently, 1 mole of Na_2SO_4 requires 1 mole of H_2SO_4.
- However, looking at the last reaction **2NaOH + H_2SO_4 → Na_2SO_4 + 2H_2O**, it's clear that 1 mole of H_2SO_4 produces 1 mole of Na_2SO_4 and 2 moles of H_2O. Thus, the water is not the limiting reagent in the production of Na_2SO_4 from the given reactions sequence when starting with sulfur, but it becomes relevant when considering the amount of water available.

Given the information and focusing on the question's specifics:
- Starting with 1 mole of sulfur, you can produce 1 mole of Na_2SO_4, as shown by the stoichiometry of the reactions.
- With 4.5 g of water (0.25 mol), considering the reaction **SO_3 (g) + H_2O (l) → H_2SO_4 (l)** and then **2NaOH + H_2SO_4 → Na_2SO_4 + 2H_2O**, the water would be sufficient to produce 0.25 mol of H_2SO_4 and subsequently 0.25 mol of Na_2SO_4, but this does not directly answer the question as it seems to imply a direct limitation by water in the final step which is not the case given the stoichiometry provided. The actual limitation by water in the sequence provided would be in the step producing H_2SO_4 from SO_3, but given the reactions, water's role is not as a limiting reagent in the overall sequence to Na_2SO_4 production from sulfur directly. The confusion arises from interpreting the role of water in the sequence. 

However, the question seems to ask for the production of Na_2SO_4 based on sulfur and then separately considers water, which might imply looking for the limiting reagent in each case. Given the direct sequence and usual interpretations, the answer should reflect the maximum production based on sulfur and then the consideration of water's limitation in the context provided.

Thus, considering the usual approach to such problems and the information provided:
- 1 mole of sulfur can produce 1 mole of Na_2SO_4.
- The consideration of water seems to be a separate inquiry rather than a direct limitation in the sequence provided, given the stoichiometry.

The correct interpretation based on the provided sequence and usual stoichiometric calculations would focus on the sulfur for the first part and then consider the water's limitation in the context of producing H_2SO_4 and subsequently Na_2SO_4. However, the direct question seems to imply a straightforward calculation based on sulfur and then a separate consideration for water, which might not directly limit the production of Na_2SO_4 in the sequence as described.

Given this analysis and focusing on the direct question:
- Starting with 1 mole of sulfur, 1 mole of Na_2SO_4 can be produced.
- The mention of water seems to be a separate point of consideration rather than a direct factor in limiting the production of Na_2SO_4 from sulfur in the given sequence.

Therefore, the answer reflecting the maximum possible production based on the given information and usual stoichiometric analysis would be:

An elevator is accelerated upward at 2 ft/sec^2. If the elevator weighs 500 lb, what is the tension in the supporting cable?

B) 531.2 lb
C) 485 lb

E) 520 lb
F) 540 lb
G) 550 lb
H) 600 lb
I) 575 lb
J) 510 lb </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the tension in the supporting cable, we need to consider the forces acting on the elevator. The elevator is accelerating upward, so there are two main forces at play: the weight of the elevator (acting downward) and the tension in the cable (acting upward). 

The weight of the elevator is given as 500 lb. When an object is accelerated upward, the net force acting on it is upward, meaning the tension in the cable must be greater than the weight of the elevator to cause the acceleration.

We can use Newton's second law of motion, F = ma, where F is the net force, m is the mass of the elevator, and a is the acceleration. Since the weight (W) of the elevator is acting downward, it is given by W = mg, where g is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately 32 ft/sec^2). The mass of the elevator can be found from its weight as m = W / g.

Given:
- Weight (W) = 500 lb
- Acceleration due to gravity (g) = 32 ft/sec^2
- Acceleration of the elevator (a) = 2 ft/sec^2

First, find the mass of the elevator:
m = W / g = 500 lb / 32 ft/sec^2 = 15.625 lb·sec^2/ft

The net force (F) acting on the elevator to cause it to accelerate upward is given by F = ma, but since we're looking for the tension (T) which acts upward, and the weight acts downward, the net force is T - W = ma.

Rearranging for T gives us:
T = ma + W

Substitute the values:
T = (15.625 lb·sec^2/ft) * (2 ft/sec^2) + 500 lb
T = 31.25 lb + 500 lb
T = 531.25 lb

Rounded to one decimal place as seen in the options, this is approximately 531.2 lb (considering rounding and slight variations in g).

Compute the stresses in a saw as it goes over the driving pulley. The saw is made up of alloy steel, E = 30 × 10^6 psi, thickness = (1 / 32"). The pulley has a diameter of 15 in.

G) 12,000 psi
H) 55,000 psi
I) 45,000 psi
J) 20,000 psi </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To compute the stresses in the saw as it goes over the driving pulley, we can consider the bending stress caused by the pulley's curvature. However, without specific details on how the saw is loaded (e.g., tension, bending moment), we'll approach this from a general perspective considering the material properties and geometry provided.

Given:
- Material: Alloy steel with \(E = 30 \times 10^6\) psi (modulus of elasticity).
- Thickness of the saw: \(1/32"\) (which is \(1/32 \times 0.0254\) meters or approximately \(0.79375\) mm, but we'll keep it in inches for consistency with the units of \(E\)).
- Pulley diameter: \(15\) inches.

The stress in a material can be calculated using the formula \(\sigma = E \cdot \epsilon\), where \(\sigma\) is stress, \(E\) is the modulus of elasticity, and \(\epsilon\) is strain. However, without a direct load or specific strain, we can't calculate stress directly from this formula.

For bending around a pulley, the bending stress (\(\sigma\)) can be estimated using the formula for bending stress in a beam, which is \(\sigma = \frac{M \cdot c}{I}\), where \(M\) is the bending moment, \(c\) is the distance from the neutral axis to the outer fiber, and \(I\) is the moment of inertia. But without the bending moment \(M\), we cannot proceed directly.

Another approach is considering the tension in the saw as it wraps around the pulley, which can induce stress due to the change in curvature. The stress due to bending around a pulley can also be considered using the formula for stress due to curvature, which involves the radius of curvature (related to the pulley diameter) and the thickness of the saw. However, a common formula for calculating stress in a belt or saw wrapped around a pulley involves the tension and the radius of the pulley, but without specific tension values, we're at an impasse for direct calculation.

Given the lack of specific loading conditions (like tension in the saw) and considering we're to select from multiple-choice options without a clear path to calculate stress directly from provided formulas, let's consider a general principle:

The bending stress (\(\sigma\)) in a thin strip (like a saw) bent around a pulley can be simplified and related to the material's properties and the geometry of the bend. For a strip of thickness \(t\) bent around a pulley of radius \(r\), the stress can be approximated by \(\sigma = E \cdot \frac{t}{2r}\) for the outer fibers, considering the neutral axis is at the midpoint of the thickness.

Given \(E = 30 \times 10^6\) psi, \(t = 1/32"\), and \(r = 15/2 = 7.5"\) (radius of the pulley), we plug these into our simplified formula:

\(\sigma = 30 \times 10^6 \cdot \frac{1/32}{2 \cdot 7.5}\)

\(\sigma = 30 \times 10^6 \cdot \frac{1}{32 \cdot 15}\)

\(\sigma = 30 \times 10^6 \cdot \frac{1}{480}\)

\(\sigma = 62,500\) psi

Thus, the closest answer, considering our simplified approach and the provided options, would be:

The full-employment gross domestic product is $1.3 trillion, and the actual gross domestic product is $1.2 trillion. The marginal propensity to consume is 0.8. When inflation is ignored, what increase in government expenditures is necessary to produce full employment?

A) $30 billion
B) $10 billion
C) $80 billion
D) $90 billion
E) $20 billion
F) $25 billion
G) $120 billion
H) $50 billion
I) $100 billion
J) $130 billion </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the necessary increase in government expenditures to produce full employment, we first need to determine the current output gap, which is the difference between the full-employment GDP and the actual GDP. 

The full-employment GDP is $1.3 trillion, and the actual GDP is $1.2 trillion. So, the output gap is $1.3 trillion - $1.2 trillion = $0.1 trillion, or $100 billion.

The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is given as 0.8. The multiplier (the increase in GDP resulting from a one-unit increase in government spending) can be calculated using the formula for the government spending multiplier, which is 1 / (1 - MPC). 

So, the multiplier = 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 1 / 0.2 = 5.

This means that for every dollar increase in government spending, GDP increases by $5. To fill an output gap of $100 billion, we divide the gap by the multiplier to find the necessary increase in government expenditures: $100 billion / 5 = $20 billion.

Therefore, the increase in government expenditures necessary to produce full employment is $20 billion.

Superheated steam enters an adiabatic turbine at 400 lbf/in^2, 600°F and leaves at a pressure of 50 lbf/in^2 and a quality of 99.5%. If the temperature of the surroundings (T_0) is 60°F, calculate the turbine efficiency, effectiveness, and loss of available energy.

J) Turbine efficiency: 65%, Effectiveness: 90%, Loss of available energy: -37 Btu/lbm </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to calculate the turbine efficiency, effectiveness, and loss of available energy. 

1. **Turbine Efficiency**: This is the ratio of the actual work output to the ideal work output (isentropic work output). To calculate this, we first need the enthalpy at the inlet and the enthalpy at the outlet if the process were isentropic.

2. **Effectiveness**: This is related to the second law efficiency or the ratio of the actual change in exergy (or available energy) to the maximum possible change in exergy.

3. **Loss of Available Energy**: This can be calculated by finding the difference in exergy between the inlet and outlet states and comparing it to the ideal case.

Given:
- Inlet pressure (P1) = 400 lbf/in^2
- Inlet temperature (T1) = 600°F
- Outlet pressure (P2) = 50 lbf/in^2
- Quality at outlet (x2) = 99.5%
- Surroundings temperature (T0) = 60°F

First, let's find the enthalpy and entropy at the inlet and outlet.

Using steam tables:
- At 400 lbf/in^2 and 600°F, we find h1 and s1.
- At 50 lbf/in^2 and x2 = 99.5%, we find h2 and s2 for the actual state.

For an isentropic process, s1 = s2s (where s2s is the entropy at the outlet for an isentropic process). We use this to find the ideal outlet state (h2s).

**Turbine Efficiency**:
\[ \eta_{turbine} = \frac{h1 - h2}{h1 - h2s} \]

**Effectiveness** (or Second Law Efficiency):
\[ \eta_{II} = \frac{(h1 - h2) - T0(s1 - s2)}{(h1 - h2s) - T0(s1 - s2s)} \]

**Loss of Available Energy**:
\[ \text{Loss} = (h1 - h2s) - T0(s1 - s2s) - [(h1 - h2) - T0(s1 - s2)] \]
\[ \text{Loss} = (h1 - h2s) - (h1 - h2) - T0[(s1 - s2s) - (s1 - s2)] \]
\[ \text{Loss} = (h2 - h2s) - T0(s2s - s2) \]

Without specific values from the steam tables, we cannot directly calculate these values here. However, the process involves looking up these values in steam tables and then applying the formulas.

Given the complexity and the need for specific steam table values, let's consider a general approach to selecting the correct answer:

- Turbine efficiency typically ranges between 70% to 90% for modern turbines.
- Effectiveness or second-law efficiency considers the exergy change and is usually higher than the first-law efficiency (turbine efficiency) because it accounts for the quality of energy.
- Loss of available energy is typically negative, indicating a loss, and its magnitude can vary widely depending on the specific conditions.

Given these general guidelines and without the ability to calculate exact values here, we must consider typical ranges and the fact that the question asks for a combination of efficiency, effectiveness, and loss of available energy, which suggests looking for an answer that balances these considerations reasonably.

The masses of _1H^1 and _2He^4 atoms are 1.00813 amu and 4.00386 amu, respectively. How much hydrogen must be converted to helium in the sun per second if the solar constant is 1.35 kW\textbulletm^2 and the earth is 1.5 × 10^8 km from the sun?

H) 6.22 × 10^11 kg
I) 5.89 × 10^11 kg
J) 6.5 × 10^11 kg </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the mass of hydrogen converted to helium and the energy released in the process. The energy released per reaction can be calculated from the difference in mass between the reactants and products, using Einstein's equation \(E = mc^2\), where \(E\) is the energy, \(m\) is the mass difference, and \(c\) is the speed of light.

The reaction for converting hydrogen to helium is:
\[4 \text{ } _1H^1 \rightarrow _2He^4\]

The mass of 4 hydrogen atoms is \(4 \times 1.00813 \text{ amu} = 4.03252 \text{ amu}\).

The mass of 1 helium atom is \(4.00386 \text{ amu}\).

The mass difference is \(4.03252 \text{ amu} - 4.00386 \text{ amu} = 0.02866 \text{ amu}\).

To convert amu to kilograms, we use the conversion factor \(1 \text{ amu} = 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}\), so:
\[0.02866 \text{ amu} \times 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/amu} = 4.757 \times 10^{-29} \text{ kg}\]

This is the mass difference per reaction. The energy released per reaction is:
\[E = mc^2 = 4.757 \times 10^{-29} \text{ kg} \times (3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s})^2 = 4.283 \times 10^{-12} \text{ J}\]

The solar constant is given as \(1.35 \text{ kW/m}^2\), which means that every square meter of the Earth's surface receives \(1.35 \times 10^3 \text{ W}\) of power from the Sun. To find the total power received by the Earth, we need the area of the Earth that faces the Sun, which is \(\pi r^2\), where \(r\) is the radius of the Earth's orbit around the Sun. Given that the Earth is \(1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km}\) from the Sun, the area is:
\[\pi \times (1.5 \times 10^8 \text{ km})^2 = \pi \times (1.5 \times 10^{11} \text{ m})^2 = 7.065 \times 10^{22} \text{ m}^2\]

The total power received by the Earth from the Sun is:
\[1.35 \times 10^3 \text{ W/m}^2 \times 7.065 \times 10^{22} \text{ m}^2 = 9.54 \times 10^{25} \text{ W}\]

Since \(1 \text{ W} = 1 \text{ J/s}\), the energy received per second is \(9.54 \times 10^{25} \text{ J}\).

Now, to find out how many reactions (and thus how much hydrogen) are needed to produce this amount of energy per second, we divide the total energy received per second by the energy released per reaction:
\[\frac{9.54 \times 10^{25} \text{ J/s}}{4.283 \times 10^{-12} \text{ J/reaction}} = 2.228 \times 10^{37} \text{ reactions/s}\]

Each reaction consumes 4 hydrogen atoms, so the number of hydrogen atoms consumed per second is:
\[2.228 \times 10^{37} \text{ reactions/s} \times 4 \text{ atoms/reaction} = 8.912 \times 10^{37} \text{ atoms/s}\]

The mass of one hydrogen atom is \(1.00813 \text{ amu} \times 1.66054 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/amu} = 1.6736 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}\).

Therefore, the mass of hydrogen consumed per second is:
\[8.912 \times 10^{37} \text{ atoms/s} \times 1.6736 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/atom} = 1.492 \times 10^{11} \text{ kg/s}\]

However, my calculation approach was to directly relate the energy output of the Sun to the mass conversion, but it seems there was a miscalculation in the steps, particularly in translating the solar constant into the energy received by the Earth and then into the mass of hydrogen needed. The correct approach should directly utilize the energy output and relate it to the mass-energy conversion efficiency of the hydrogen to helium reaction, considering the entire Sun's energy output rather than just what's received by Earth. 

Given the nature of the question and the standard formulae involved, let's correct the approach for calculating the mass of hydrogen that must be converted to helium per second, based on the Sun's total energy output and the energy yield per hydrogen atom converted:

The Sun's total energy output (luminosity) is about \(3.8 \times 10^{26} \text{ W}\). Each conversion of 4 hydrogen atoms to 1 helium atom releases \(4.283 \times 10^{-12} \text{ J}\) of energy. 

To find the number of reactions per second that release this amount of energy:
\[3.8 \times 10^{26} \text{ J/s} / (4.283 \times 10^{-12} \text{ J/reaction}) = 8.87 \times 10^{37} \text{ reactions/s}\]

Each reaction involves 4 hydrogen atoms, each with a mass of \(1.6736 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg}\), so the mass of hydrogen converted per second is:
\[8.87 \times 10^{37} \text{ reactions/s} \times 4 \text{ atoms/reaction} \times 1.6736 \times 10^{-27} \text{ kg/atom} = 5.94 \times 10^{11} \text{ kg/s}\]

This calculation seems to align more closely with the expected range of answers, considering the simplifications and rounding used. However, the precise calculation should directly use the solar luminosity and the energy yield per reaction without intermediate steps that might introduce inaccuracies.

Given the closest match and acknowledging the potential for minor calculation discrepancies:

Writings which do not belong to one of the above-mentioned classes shall be treated according to the laws now in force, or which may be enacted, in the individual states of the union. . . . Each state of the union is responsible, not only to the state against which the offense is directly committed, but to the whole Confederation, for every publication appearing under its supervision in which the honor or security of other states is infringed or their constitution or administration attacked. . . .
—Carlsbad Resolutions adopted by the Germanic States, 1819
The Carlsbad Resolutions were another of Metternich's schemes, like the Concert of Europe, which aimed to accomplish which of the following?

A) Promote the industrial revolution across the continent.
B) Suppress all voices in government other than his own and control all aspects of his citizens' lives.
C) Suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent.

H) Establish control of European states by democracy in the tradition of the Enlightenment.
I) Promote religious freedom across the Germanic States.
J) Establish a single, universal language across all European states. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Carlsbad Resolutions**: The Carlsbad Resolutions were adopted by the Germanic States in 1819. This regulation focuses on press law, requiring publications to have previous knowledge and approval from state officials before going to press. It also holds each state responsible for ensuring that publications under its supervision do not infringe on the honor or security of other states or attack their constitution or administration.

2. **Metternich's Schemes**: The question mentions that the Carlsbad Resolutions were another of Metternich's schemes, similar to the Concert of Europe. Metternich was known for his efforts to maintain the political status quo and suppress revolutionary movements in Europe during the early 19th century.

3. **Analyzing the Options**:
   - **A**: Promote the industrial revolution across the continent. This does not align with the content of the Carlsbad Resolutions or Metternich's known goals.
   - **B**: Suppress all voices in government other than his own and control all aspects of his citizens' lives. While Metternich did aim to maintain control, the Carlsbad Resolutions specifically focus on press control and inter-state relations.
   - **C**: Suppress all nationalist revolutions across the continent. This option aligns with Metternich's goals, as the Carlsbad Resolutions can be seen as a tool to prevent the spread of nationalist or revolutionary ideas through the press.
   - **D**: Suppress all speech but that of monarchs and the churches that they approve of. This is close, as the resolutions do aim to control speech, but it's more about preventing criticism of states and their administrations than solely promoting monarchist and approved church views.
   - **E**: Promote the spread of democratic revolutions. This is the opposite of Metternich's intentions, as he sought to suppress such movements.
   - **F**, **G**, **H**, **I**, **J**: These options do not directly relate to the content or purpose of the Carlsbad Resolutions as described.

Given the analysis, the Carlsbad Resolutions and Metternich's schemes were primarily aimed at maintaining control and suppressing movements that could threaten the existing order, such as nationalist revolutions.

###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to determine the region within the rectangle \(ABCD\) where a point is closer to the center \(O\) than to any of the vertices \(A\), \(B\), \(C\), or \(D\).

1. **Identify the coordinates of the vertices and the center:**
   - Let \(A = (-a, b)\), \(B = (a, b)\), \(C = (a, -b)\), and \(D = (-a, -b)\).
   - The center \(O\) is at \((0, 0)\).

2. **Determine the regions where a point is closer to \(O\) than to the vertices:**
   - A point \((x, y)\) is closer to \(O\) than to \(A\) if \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < \sqrt{(x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2}\).
   - Simplifying, we get \(x^2 + y^2 < (x + a)^2 + (y - b)^2\).
   - Expanding and simplifying further, we get \(x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2\).
   - This simplifies to \(0 < 2ax + a^2 - 2by + b^2\).
   - Rearranging, we get \(2by > 2ax + a^2 + b^2\).
   - Dividing by 2, we get \(by > ax + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\).

3. **Repeat for the other vertices:**
   - Similarly, we can derive the inequalities for the other vertices:
     - Closer to \(O\) than to \(B\): \(by > -ax + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\).
     - Closer to \(O\) than to \(C\): \(-by > ax + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\).
     - Closer to \(O\) than to \(D\): \(-by > -ax + \frac{a^2 + b^2}{2}\).

4. **Find the intersection of these regions:**
   - The intersection of these regions forms a smaller rectangle centered at \(O\) with sides parallel to the axes.

5. **Calculate the area of the smaller rectangle:**
   - The side lengths of the smaller rectangle are determined by the inequalities.
   - The distance from \(O\) to the sides of the smaller rectangle is \(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{2k}\) (since \(k = \frac{AB}{AD}\)).

6. **Calculate the area of the smaller rectangle:**
   - The area of the smaller rectangle is \(\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{k}\right)^2\).

7. **Calculate the area of the original rectangle:**
   - The area of the original rectangle is \(4ab\).

8. **Find the probability:**
   - The probability is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the original rectangle.
   - \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{\left(\frac{a^2 + b^2}{k}\right)^2}{4ab}
   \]

9. **Simplify the expression:**
   - \[
   \text{Probability} = \frac{(a^2 + b^2)^2}{4abk^2}
   \]

10. **Given \(k = \frac{AB}{AD}\), we can express \(a\) and \(b\) in terms of \(k\):**
    - Let \(AB = ka\) and \(AD = a\).
    - Then \(a^2 + b^2 = a^2 + (ka)^2 = a^2(1 + k^2)\).

11. **Substitute back into the probability expression:**
    - \[
    \text{Probability} = \frac{(a^2(1 + k^2))^2}{4a^2k^2} = \frac{a^4(1 + k^2)^2}{4a^2k^2} = \frac{a^2(1 + k^2)^2}{4k^2}
    \]

12. **Simplify further:**
    - \[
    \text{Probability} = \frac{(1 + k^2)^2}{4k^2}
    \]

13. **Final answer:**
    - \[
    \boxed{\frac{(1 + k^2)^2}{4k^2}}
    \] </pre>

<pre> Solve the following math problem step by step. The last line of your response should be of the form Answer: $ANSWER (without quotes) where $ANSWER is the answer to the problem.

Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be distinct real numbers.  Find the degree of the polynomial
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]

###### answer
<pre> To determine the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \), we start by analyzing the given expression:
\[ p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}. \]

Each term in the sum is a rational function where the numerator is a quadratic polynomial and the denominator is a product of two linear factors. However, the key insight is to recognize that \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 1. This can be shown by evaluating \( p(x) \) at specific points.

First, let's evaluate \( p(x) \) at \( x = a \):
\[ p(a) = \frac{(a - b)(a - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(a - a)(a - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 1 + 0 + 0 = 1. \]

Next, let's evaluate \( p(x) \) at \( x = b \):
\[ p(b) = \frac{(b - b)(b - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(b - a)(b - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 1 + 0 = 1. \]

Finally, let's evaluate \( p(x) \) at \( x = c \):
\[ p(c) = \frac{(c - b)(c - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(c - a)(c - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)} = 0 + 0 + 1 = 1. \]

From these evaluations, we see that \( p(a) = 1 \), \( p(b) = 1 \), and \( p(c) = 1 \). This suggests that \( p(x) \) is a polynomial of degree 1 that takes the value 1 at three distinct points \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \). The only polynomial of degree 1 that can satisfy this condition is a constant polynomial, but since the polynomial is not constant (it is a sum of rational functions), it must be a linear polynomial of the form \( p(x) = 1 \).

Therefore, the degree of the polynomial \( p(x) \) is:
\[ \boxed{1} \] </pre>

Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to break down the time Tom spends traveling and returning separately. Here are the key points:

1. **Travel Time**: Tom starts his journey at 1 PM and ends at 4 PM. This gives us a total duration of 3 hours (4 PM - 1 PM).
2. **Speed**: His speed while traveling is 10 miles per hour.
3. **Distance Traveled**: Distance = Speed × Time. Therefore, distance traveled during the trip = 10 miles/hour × 3 hours = 30 miles.

Next, let's consider the return trip:

1. **Return Speed**: The return speed is 6 miles per hour.
2. **Time for Return Trip**: Since he needs to cover the same distance as the outbound trip, the return time will also be 3 hours.

Now, we calculate the return time:
- Distance = Speed × Time. Therefore, distance traveled during the return trip = 6 miles/hour × 3 hours = 18 miles.

Finally, we sum up both times:
- Total time spent traveling = 3 hours
- Total time spent returning = 3 hours

Therefore, the total time taken for the round trip is:

$$
\text{Total Time} = \text{Time Spent Traveling} + \text{Time Spent Returning} = 3 \, \text{hours} + 3 \, \text{hours} = 6 \, \text{hours}.
$$

According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Determine the number of servings in a 300g bag**: The bag contains 5 servings.
   
2. **Calculate the number of calories per serving**: Each serving has 250 calories.

3. **Calculate the total calories in the bag**: Since there are 5 servings, multiply the number of servings by the calories per serving. This gives us $5 \times 250 = 1250$ calories.

4. **Set up the equation for the remaining calories needed to reach the daily target**: We need to find out how many grams of chips we can eat given that our current consumption is 1800 calories and our daily target is 2000 calories.

   Let $x$ be the number of grams of chips eaten. Then, the equation is:
   
   $$
   1250 + x = 2000
   $$

5. **Solve for $x$**: Subtract 1250 from both sides of the equation to isolate $x$:
   
   $$
   x = 2000 - 1250
   $$

6. **Perform the subtraction**:
   
   $$
   x = 750
   $$

Therefore, if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can eat 750 grams of chips.

**Final Answer**: 750 </pre>

### penguins_in_a_table/112
###### instruction
<pre> Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the shortest height?
Options:
(A) 50
(B) 80
(C) 60
(D) 70
(E) 90 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

This question focuses on height. We know the following: The heights of the penguins are 50 cm for Louis, 80 cm for Bernard, 60 cm for Vincent, and 70 cm for Gwen.

The shortest height is 50 cm, which belongs to Louis.

So the answer is (A) 50 cm. </pre>

### sports_understanding/34
###### instruction
<pre> Determine whether an artificially constructed sentence relating to sports is plausible or not.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Tom Wilson scored a penalty kick." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step. Tom Wilson is a hockey player. Penalty kicks are part of football (soccer) and some other sports like field hockey. Since this question pertains to hockey, we need to consider if scoring a penalty kick is plausible in that context.

In ice hockey, a penalty shot can be awarded instead of a penalty kick, where a player attempts to score against the opposing goaltender without interference from other players. This is different from a penalty kick in soccer, which involves taking a shot directly on goal from a set spot on the field.

Given these points, the final answer is:

**Yes, it is plausible for Tom Wilson to score a penalty kick in hockey.** </pre>

### logical_deduction_five_objects/45
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are five birds: a cardinal, a crow, a falcon, a robin, and a blue jay. The robin is to the right of the cardinal. The cardinal is to the right of the blue jay. The blue jay is the second from the left. The crow is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The cardinal is the rightmost
(B) The crow is the rightmost
(C) The falcon is the rightmost
(D) The robin is the rightmost
(E) The blue jay is the rightmost </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct order of the objects based on the given descriptions, let’s analyze each scenario step-by-step:

### Scenario 1: Golf Tournament
**Statements:**
1. **Eve finished above Amy:** "Eve" is above "Amy."
2. **Eli finished below Amy:** "Eli" is below "Amy."

Combining these two statements gives us the following order:
- Eve
- Amy
- Eli

Since Eli finished last, he must be at the bottom of the list. Therefore, the final order is:
- Eve
- Amy
- Eli

So, Eli finished last. The answer is (B): Eli finished last.

---

### Scenario 2: Shelf with Books
**Statements:**
1. **Green book is to the right of the white book:** "White" is to the left of "Green."
2. **Orange book is the rightmost:** "Orange" is the farthest to the right.

Combining these two statements gives us the following order:
- White
- Green
- Orange

Thus, the leftmost book is the white book. The answer is (A): The white book is the leftmost.

---

### Scenario 3: Shelf with Books
**Statements:**
1. **White book is to the left of the gray book:** "Gray" is to the right of "White."
2. **Red book is the second from the left:** "Red" is the second book counting from the left.

Combining these two statements gives us the following order:
- Red
- White
- Gray
- ...

The third position is taken by the gray book. Thus, the leftmost book is the white book. The answer is (C): The white book is the leftmost.

---

### Scenario 4: Branch with Birds
**Statements:**
1. **Robin is to the right of cardinal:** "Cardinal" is to the left of "Robin."
2. **Cardinal is to the right of blue jay:** "Blue Jay" is to the left of "Cardinal."
3. **Blue jay is the second from the left:** "Blue Jay" is the second bird counting from the left.
4. **Crow is the rightmost:** "Crow" is the farthest to the right.

Combining these four statements gives us the following order:
- Blue Jay
- Cardinal
- Robin
- Falcon
- Crow

Therefore, the rightmost bird is the crow. The answer is (B): The crow is the rightmost. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/214
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: There exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel while not a niece of Nelda. Nobody is neither a stepsister of Christine nor a niece of Nelda. So, necessarily, there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel and a stepsister of Christine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) There exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel while not a niece of Nelda: $\exists x (workmate\_of(Guadalupe, x) \land ancestor\_of(x, Jewel) \land \neg niece\_of(x, Nelda))$

(2) Nobody is neither a stepsister of Christine nor a niece of Nelda: $\forall x (\neg stepsister\_of(x, Christine) \land \neg niece\_of(x, Nelda))$

Hypothesis: Is it necessary that there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel and a stepsister of Christine?

We need to analyze the implications of the statements provided.

From (1), we know that there exists someone who is a workmate of Guadalupe, an ancestor of Jewel, and not a niece of Nelda. This means such a person must exist.

From (2), we know that nobody is both a stepsister of Christine and a niece of Nelda. Therefore, any potential stepsister of Christine would also need to satisfy the condition of not being a niece of Nelda.

Combining these two pieces of information, we can reason that since there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel but not a niece of Nelda, and considering that no one can simultaneously be a stepsister of Christine and a niece of Nelda, it follows logically that this workmate must also be a stepsister of Christine.

Thus, the hypothesis holds true based on the given premises.

Therefore, the argument is **valid**. </pre>

### snarks/52
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) It's not our job to fund education! It should be the government paying the maintenance to keep schools open
(B) It's not our job to fund education! It should be the kids paying the maintenance to keep schools open </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. **Option (A):** "It's not our job to fund education! It should be the government paying the maintenance to keep schools open."
   - This statement implies that the responsibility for funding education should lie with the government instead of individuals or private entities. 
   - While it might be seen as critical or disapproving of current arrangements, it doesn’t necessarily imply sarcasm unless delivered in a particularly mocking tone.

2. **Option (B):** "It's not our job to fund education! It should be the kids paying the maintenance to keep schools open."
   - This statement shifts the burden from the government to students, suggesting that children should bear the financial responsibility for maintaining schools.
   - Given that this reversal of typical responsibilities can be interpreted ironically or sarcastically, especially if said in a mocking or exaggerated manner, it fits the definition of sarcasm more closely.

Given these arguments, the sarcastic statement is:

**Option B:** "It's not our job to fund education! It should be the kids paying the maintenance to keep schools open." </pre>

(B) The minivan is the oldest
(C) The truck is the oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> All four questions follow the same reasoning process. Here’s a summary of how you can approach these types of problems:

1. **Identify the relationships given in each paragraph**: Each question provides information about the relative positions or conditions of certain objects. For example, "Eve finished above Amy" means that Eve is positioned higher up in the sequence compared to Amy.

2. **Combine the relationships into a single sequence**: Using the relationships provided, construct a complete sequence where each object is placed correctly based on its relationship with other objects.

3. **Determine the final position of each object**: Once you have constructed the sequence, identify the position of each object in the sequence. This will help you determine the leftmost, rightmost, or last object in the sequence.

4. **Match the determined position with the options provided**: Compare the position of each object with the possible answers to find the correct option.

Let’s apply this method to the first question:

### Question 1:
- **Statements**: Eve finished above Amy; Eli finished below Amy.
- **Sequence**: Eve Amy Eli
- **Position Determination**: Eli is at the bottom of the sequence.
- **Answer**: Eli finished last. So the answer is (B) Eli finished last.

Now let’s move onto the next question:

### Question 2:
- **Statements**: The green book is to the right of the white book; the orange book is the rightmost.
- **Sequence**: White book green book orange book
- **Position Determination**: The white book is at the far left.
- **Answer**: The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A) The white book is the leftmost.

Next:

### Question 3:
- **Statements**: The white book is to the left of the gray book; the red book is the second from the left.
- **Sequence**: White book gray book red book
- **Position Determination**: The white book is at the far left.
- **Answer**: The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C) The white book is the leftmost.

Finally:

### Question 4:
- **Statements**: The minivan is newer than the truck; the station wagon is newer than the minivan.
- **Sequence**: Station wagon minivan truck
- **Position Determination**: The truck is at the very end.
- **Answer**: The truck is the oldest. So the answer is (C) The truck is the oldest.

Thus, the correct answers for each question are:

1. (B) Eli finished last
2. (A) The white book is the leftmost
3. (C) The white book is the leftmost
4. (C) The truck is the oldest </pre>

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((6 - 0 * 5 + -3) * (6 - -7 + -2 - -7)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses on both sides of the equation.

On the left side:
$$(6 - 0 \cdot 5 + -3) = (6 - 3) = 3.$$

Now, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses on the right side:
$$(6 - (-7) + -2 - (-7)) = (6 + 7 - 2 + 7) = (6 + 7 + 7 - 2) = (6 + 7 + 7) - 2 = 20 - 2 = 18.$$

So now we have:
$$3 \cdot 18 = 54.$$

Therefore, the answer is $54$. </pre>

Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((5 * 7 * -4 + 7) * (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

First, let's break down the problem into smaller parts:

1. Calculate the value of $A$:
   $$ A = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot -4 + 7 $$
   
2. Calculate the value of $B$:
   $$ B = -5 - (-6) + -8 \cdot -5 $$

3. Finally, multiply $A$ and $B$ together:
   $$ A \cdot B $$

Now, let's solve each part step by step:

### Step 1: Calculating $A$
$$ A = 5 \cdot 7 \cdot -4 + 7 $$

Calculate the product of $5$, $7$, and $-4$:
$$ 5 \cdot 7 = 35 $$
$$ 35 \cdot -4 = -140 $$
Add $7$ to the result:
$$ -140 + 7 = -133 $$
So, we have:
$$ A = -133 $$

### Step 2: Calculating $B$
$$ B = -5 - (-6) + -8 \cdot -5 $$

Simplify the expression:
$$ -5 - (-6) = -5 + 6 = 1 $$
Multiply $-8$ by $5$:
$$ -8 \cdot -5 = 40 $$

So, we have:
$$ B = 1 + 40 = 41 $$

### Step 3: Multiplying $A$ and $B$
Finally, multiply $A$ and $B$:
$$ A \cdot B = -133 \cdot 41 $$

Since $133$ and $41$ are both odd numbers, their product will also be an odd number. Therefore, the sign of the product remains negative:
$$ -133 \cdot 41 = -5453 $$

Thus, the final answer is:
$$ -5453 $$ </pre>

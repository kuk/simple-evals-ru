###### answer
<pre> ## Step 1: To solve this problem, we first need to understand the geometric setup and what the question is asking.
The problem involves a rectangle $ABCD$ with center $O$ and the ratio of the lengths of its sides $AB$ to $AD$ given as $k$. We are tasked with finding the probability that a point chosen randomly from the interior of the rectangle is closer to the center $O$ than to any of the four vertices.

## Step 2: The key insight is to determine the region of points that are closer to $O$ than to any of the vertices.
This region can be found by drawing the perpendicular bisectors of the line segments joining $O$ to each of the vertices. These bisectors create a smaller rectangle within $ABCD$.

## Step 3: To find the area of this smaller rectangle, we consider the lengths of its sides.
Let's denote $AB = k$ and $AD = 1$. The distance from $O$ to any vertex is half the length of the diagonal of the rectangle, which can be found using the Pythagorean theorem: $\sqrt{(k/2)^2 + (1/2)^2} = \sqrt{k^2/4 + 1/4} = \sqrt{(k^2+1)/4} = \sqrt{k^2+1}/2$.

## Step 4: The perpendicular bisectors of the line segments $OA$, $OB$, $OC$, and $OD$ divide the rectangle into smaller regions.
The region closer to $O$ than to any vertex is a smaller rectangle formed by these bisectors. The sides of this smaller rectangle are $k/2$ and $1/2$.

## Step 5: The area of the smaller rectangle can be calculated as the product of its sides.
Thus, the area of the region closer to $O$ is $(k/2) \times (1/2) = k/4$.

## Step 6: The area of the entire rectangle $ABCD$ is the product of its sides $AB$ and $AD$.
So, the area of $ABCD$ is $k \times 1 = k$.

## Step 7: The probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any of the vertices can be found by taking the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the entire rectangle.
This probability is $\frac{k/4}{k} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The final answer is: $\frac{1}{4}$ </pre>

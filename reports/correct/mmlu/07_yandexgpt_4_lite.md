based upon rewardor punishment or based upon a need to know. Distinguish on a more specific plane between the three kinds ofresponses to social influence.

A) Conformity, association, and adaptation
B) Agreement, alliance, and absorption
C) Compliance, identification, and internalization
D) Submission, emulation, and inculcation
E) Adherence, affiliation, and incorporation
F) Cooperation, imitation, and assimilation
G) Obedience, integration, and acculturation
H) Respect, imitation, and socialization
I) Acquiescence, imitation, and enculturation
J) Coordination, assimilation, and conformation </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Conformity, agreement, and compliance are all types of responses to social influence.
Conformity involves changing one's behavior or opinions to match those of others.
Agreement refers to publicly accepting the opinions or behaviors of others, even if privately you may not agree.
Compliance involves acting in accordance with a direct request from another person.

What is the tax on a house with a market value of $18,400, if theassessed value is at 65% and the tax rate is $4.57 per $100.

A) $580.99
B) $400.55
C) $300.25
D) $450.67
E) $625.44
F) $489.30
G) $735.60
H) $650.75
I) $700.90
J) $546.57 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the tax on a house, we need to multiply the assessed value by the tax rate.
The assessed value is 65% of the market value, so it is $18,400 * 0.65 = $11,960.
Then, we multiply the assessed value by the tax rate: $11,960 * $4.57 / $100 = $546.57.

An oscillator which emits high frequency waves at 0.26 GHz is set up in front of a large plane metal reflector. Standing waves are formed with nodes 57.5 cm apart. Neglecting the refractive index of air, compute the velocity of light.

A) 5.98 × 10^10 cm/sec
B) 3.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
C) 3.00 × 10^10 cm/sec
D) 2.99 × 10^11 cm/sec
E) 2.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
F) 2.99 × 10^9 cm/sec
G) 1.49 × 10^10 cm/sec
H) 1.99 × 10^11 cm/sec
I) 1.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
J) 4.99 × 10^10 cm/sec </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The wavelength of the standing waves can be calculated using the formula:

$\lambda = 2d$,

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $d$ is the distance between the nodes.

We are given that the distance between the nodes is 57.5 cm, so the wavelength is:

$\lambda = 2 \times 57.5 = 115$ cm.

The velocity of light can be calculated using the formula:

$v = f \lambda$,

where $v$ is the velocity of light, $f$ is the frequency, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

We are given that the frequency of the oscillator is 0.26 GHz, so the velocity of light is:

$v = 0.26 \times 10^9 \times 115 = 2.99 \times 10^{10}$ cm/sec.

 Which of the following claims would Leopold clearly accept?

A) The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment ultimately concern how human beings should treat each other.
B) We should think in terms of "the balance of nature" to properly appreciate the value of the natural environment.
C) The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems.
D) We should ignore all economic motives in deciding questions about land use. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> C) The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems.

Leopold, as an environmentalist, would likely agree with the claim that the problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems. This aligns with his philosophy of land ethics and his emphasis on the interconnectedness of all living things.

Which of the following is LEAST likely to indicate a phishing attack?

A) An e-mail from a utility company asks you to enter your date of birth and social security number for verification purposes
B) An e-mail from a social networking site asks you to click on a link to view a photo or video
C) An e-mail from your bank asks you to reply with your password to confirm a recent transaction.
D) An e-mail indicates that you have won a large sum of money and asks you to enter your bank account number so that the money can be transferred to you
E) An e-mail from a merchant asks that you click on a link to reset your password
F) An e-mail from your company's IT department asks you to enter your login details to upgrade your system
G) An e-mail from an online retailer asks for your payment card details to confirm a purchase
H) An e-mail from your bank asks you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The most likely scenario to indicate a phishing attack is when an e-mail asks you to enter personal information or password in response to a request that seems suspicious or urgent.

Therefore, the least likely to indicate a phishing attack would be an e-mail from your bank asking you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction.

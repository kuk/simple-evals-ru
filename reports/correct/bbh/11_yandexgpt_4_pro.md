(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 < 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 < 2 < 6 < 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 < 1 < 8 < 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

### disambiguation_qa/100
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.
Options:
(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
(B) The receptionist was in a good mood
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun «she» might be referring to. There are two possible referents for «she», namely the mechanic and the receptionist. The verb phrase «greets the receptionist» might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the mechanic and Y the receptionist. The sentence is then of the form «X greets Y because Y was in a good mood».
Let's consider Y first: «X greets Y because Y was in a good mood.» This case makes sense, because it is reasonable that the reason X greets Y is that Y is in a good mood.
Now, consider X: «X greets Y because X was in a good mood.» It is also reasonable that X is greeting Y because X is in a good mood, not because of Y's mood. Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C). </pre>

###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to use the given data to calculate the standard heat of reaction at 500°C. The data provided includes the standard heat of reaction at 25°C, as well as the heat capacities (α, β, and γ) for each substance involved in the reaction.

First, we need to calculate the standard heat of reaction at 500°C using the formula:

ΔH_reaction(T) = ΔH_reaction(25°C) + ∑(n_i \* C_p_i \* (T - 25°C))

where n_i is the number of moles of each substance, C_p_i is the heat capacity of each substance, and T is the temperature in Kelvin.

We need to convert the temperature from Celsius to Kelvin: 500°C = 773 K.

Now, let's calculate the standard heat of reaction at 500°C:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = -22.08 kcal + (3 \* 6.947 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* (773 K - 298 K)) + (1 \* 8.812 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* (773 K - 298 K)) + (1 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* (773 K - 298 K))

First, let's calculate the heat of reaction for H_2:

(3 \* 6.947 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* (773 K - 298 K)) = (3 \* 6.947 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* 475 K) = 12, 511, 475 cal/mol

Next, let's calculate the heat of reaction for NH_3:

(1 \* 8.812 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* (773 K - 298 K)) = (1 \* 8.812 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* 475 K) = 4, 192, 550 cal/mol

Finally, let's calculate the heat of reaction for N_2:

(1 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* (773 K - 298 K)) = (1 \* 10^3 cal/mol \* K \* 475 K) = 475, 000 cal/mol

Now, let's add up the heat of reaction for each substance:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = -22.08 kcal + 12, 511, 475 cal/mol + 4, 192, 550 cal/mol + 475, 000 cal/mol

First, let's convert the kcal to cal: -22.08 kcal \* 4, 184 cal/kcal = -92, 499.2 cal

Now, let's add up the heat of reaction for each substance:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = -92, 499.2 cal + 12, 511, 475 cal/mol + 4, 192, 550 cal/mol + 475, 000 cal/mol

To get the total heat of reaction, we need to multiply the heat of reaction for each substance by the number of moles:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = (-92, 499.2 cal/mol \* 3) + (12, 511, 475 cal/mol \* 3) + (4, 192, 550 cal/mol \* 2) + (475, 000 cal/mol \* 2)

Now, let's calculate the total heat of reaction:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = -277, 497.6 cal + 37, 534, 425 cal + 8, 385, 100 cal + 950, 000 cal

Now, let's add up the heat of reaction for each substance:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = 46, 592, 028 cal

Now, let's divide the total heat of reaction by the number of moles:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = 46, 592, 028 cal / 3 = 15, 530, 676 cal

Now, let's round the answer to the nearest whole number:

ΔH_reaction(500°C) = 15, 530, 676 cal ≈ 15, 193 cal

The closest answer is F) 15.193 cal.

When an electron in a certain excited energy level in a one-dimensional box of length $2.00  Å$ makes a transition to the ground state, a photon of wavelength $8.79 \mathrm{~nm}$ is emitted. Find the quantum number of the initial state.

###### answer
<pre> The energy of the photon is given by $E_{\text {photon }}=\frac{h c}{\lambda}$ where $h$ is Planck's constant, $c$ is the speed of light, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of the photon. The energy of the photon is also given by $E_{\text {photon }}=E_{i}-E_{f}$ where $E_{i}$ is the energy of the initial state and $E_{f}$ is the energy of the final state. Therefore, we can write $\frac{h c}{\lambda}=E_{i}-E_{f}$ The energy of the $n$ th state of a particle in a one-dimensional box is given by $E_{n}=\frac{n^{2} h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$ where $m$ is the mass of the particle and $L$ is the length of the box. Therefore, we can write $\frac{h c}{\lambda}=\frac{i^{2} h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}-\frac{f^{2} h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$ where $i$ is the quantum number of the initial state and $f$ is the quantum number of the final state. Since the final state is the ground state, we know that $f=1$. Therefore, we can write $\frac{h c}{\lambda}=\frac{i^{2} h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}-\frac{h^{2}}{8 m L^{2}}$ We can simplify this equation by canceling out the $h^{2}$ term: $\frac{h c}{\lambda}=\frac{i^{2}-1}{8 m L^{2}}$ We can solve this equation for $i$ by multiplying both sides by $8 m L^{2}$ and then taking the square root of both sides: $i=\sqrt{\frac{8 m L^{2} h c}{\lambda}+1}$ We can plug in the values given in the problem to find the value of $i$ : $i=\sqrt{\frac{8(9.11 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg})(2.00 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m})^{2}\left(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \cdot \mathrm{~s}\right)\left(3.00 \times 10^{8} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}\right)}{\left(8.79 \times 10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}\right)}+1}$ $i=\sqrt{1.38 \times 10^{5}+1}$ $i=\sqrt{1.38 \times 10^{5}}$ $i=1.18 \times 10^{2}$ Since the quantum number of the initial state must be an integer, we round down to the nearest integer: $i=10$ Answer: A </pre>

J) 5.32 $10^{14} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The energy of the $n$ th state of a particle in a three-dimensional rectangular box is given by
$$E_{n_{x}, n_{y}, n_{z}}=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\left(\frac{n_{x}}{L_{x}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n_{y}}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{n_{z}}{L_{z}}\right)^{2}\right]$$
where $m$ is the mass of the particle, $L_{x}$, $L_{y}$, and $L_{z}$ are the dimensions of the box, and $h$ is Planck's constant. The ground state of the box is the state with $n_{x}=1, n_{y}=1, n_{z}=1$ and the first excited state is the state with $n_{x}=1, n_{y}=2, n_{z}=1$. The energy of the ground state is
$$E_{1,1,1}=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\left(\frac{1}{L_{x}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{L_{z}}\right)^{2}\right]$$
and the energy of the first excited state is
$$E_{1,2,1}=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\left(\frac{1}{L_{x}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{2}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{L_{z}}\right)^{2}\right]$$
The energy of the photon emitted is the difference between the energy of the first excited state and the energy of the ground state:
$$\Delta E=E_{1,2,1}-E_{1,1,1}=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\left(\frac{1}{L_{x}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{2}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{L_{z}}\right)^{2}\right]-\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\left(\frac{1}{L_{x}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{1}{L_{z}}\right)^{2}\right]$$
$$=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\left(\frac{2}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}-\left(\frac{1}{L_{y}}\right)^{2}\right]=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m}\left[\frac{4}{L_{y}^{2}}-\frac{1}{L_{y}^{2}}\right]=\frac{h^{2}}{8 m L_{y}^{2}}\left(4-1\right)=\frac{3 h^{2}}{8 m L_{y}^{2}}$$
The frequency of the photon is given by
$$\nu=\frac{\Delta E}{h}=\frac{3 h^{2}}{8 m L_{y}^{2} h}=\frac{3 h}{8 m L_{y}^{2}}$$
Substituting the values of $h=6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~s}$, $m=9.109 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg}$, and $L_{y}=3.00 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}$, we obtain
$$\nu=\frac{3\left(6.626 \times 10^{-34} \mathrm{~J} \mathrm{~s}\right)}{8\left(9.109 \times 10^{-31} \mathrm{~kg}\right)\left(3.00 \times 10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\right)^{2}}=7.99 \times 10^{14} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$$

Shot towers were popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for dropping melted lead down tall towers to form spheres for bullets. The lead solidified while falling and often landed in water to cool the lead bullets. Many such shot towers were built in New York State. Assume a shot tower was constructed at latitude $42^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, and the lead fell a distance of $27 \mathrm{~m}$. In what direction and how far did the lead bullets land from the direct vertical?

A) 1.89 $\mathrm{~mm}$
B) 3.52 $\mathrm{~mm}$
C) 5.14 mm directly south due to Coriolis effect
D) 2.68 $\mathrm{~mm}$
E) 3.02 mm to the North due to Earth's rotation
F) 1.15 mm to the West due to Earth's rotation
G) 2.26 $\mathrm{~mm}$

I) 4.73 mm to the East due to Earth's rotation
J) 0.76 mm to the East due to local wind conditions </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The Coriolis effect is a result of Earth's rotation and is most pronounced at high latitudes. The Coriolis effect is negligible at low latitudes. The Coriolis effect is a deflection to the right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere. The Coriolis effect is proportional to the latitude and the velocity of the object. The velocity of the lead is $v=\sqrt{2 g h}$, where $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity and $h$ is the height of the tower. The velocity of the lead is $v=\sqrt{2(9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2})(27 \mathrm{~m})}=21.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$. The Coriolis acceleration is $a_{c}=\frac{2 \Omega v}{\pi} \sin \phi$, where $\Omega$ is the angular velocity of Earth and $\phi$ is the latitude. The Coriolis acceleration is $a_{c}=\frac{2(7.29 \times 10^{-5} \mathrm{~s}^{-1})(21.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})}{\pi} \sin 42^{\circ}=0.0013 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. The Coriolis force is $F_{c}=m a_{c}$, where $m$ is the mass of the lead. The mass of the lead is $m=\rho V$, where $\rho$ is the density of the lead and $V$ is the volume of the lead. The volume of the lead is $V=\frac{4}{3} \pi r^{3}$, where $r$ is the radius of the lead. The radius of the lead is $r=\frac{27 \mathrm{~m}}{4}=6.75 \mathrm{~m}$. The density of the lead is $\rho=11,340 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3}$. The mass of the lead is $m=(11,340 \mathrm{~kg} / \mathrm{m}^{3})\left(\frac{4}{3} \pi(6.75 \mathrm{~m})^{3}\right)=1.31 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}$. The Coriolis force is $F_{c}=(1.31 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg})(0.0013 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2})=169 \mathrm{~N}$. The Coriolis force is $F_{c}=m a_{c}$, where $a_{c}$ is the Coriolis acceleration. The Coriolis acceleration is $a_{c}=\frac{F_{c}}{m}=\frac{169 \mathrm{~N}}{1.31 \times 10^{5} \mathrm{~kg}}=1.29 \times 10^{-3} \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}$. The time it takes for the lead to fall is $t=\sqrt{\frac{2 h}{g}}$, where $h$ is the height of the tower and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity. The time it takes for the lead to fall is $t=\sqrt{\frac{2(27 \mathrm{~m})}{9.8 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}^{2}}}=2.96 \mathrm{~s}$. The distance the lead travels due to the Coriolis effect is $d=v t$, where $v$ is the velocity of the lead and $t$ is the time it takes for the lead to fall. The distance the lead travels due to the Coriolis effect is $d=(21.7 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s})(2.96 \mathrm{~s})=64.1 \mathrm{~mm}$. The Coriolis effect is a deflection to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. The lead lands $64.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ to the right of the direct vertical. The lead lands $64.1 \mathrm{~mm}$ to the South-East of the direct vertical. The correct answer is H.

J) $1.92 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The electric field at the surface of a uniformly charged sphere is given by $E=\frac{k Q}{R^{2}}$ where $Q$ is the charge of the sphere and $R$ is the radius of the sphere. The charge of the sphere is the charge of the protons, $Q=94 e$ where $e=1.60 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}$ is the charge of a proton. The radius of the sphere is given as $R=6.64 \mathrm{fm}=6.64 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m}$. Therefore, the electric field at the surface of the sphere is $E=\frac{\left(9.00 \times 10^{9} \mathrm{~N} \cdot \mathrm{m}^{2} / \mathrm{C}^{2}\right)\left(94\left(1.60 \times 10^{-19} \mathrm{C}\right)\right)}{\left(6.64 \times 10^{-15} \mathrm{m}\right)^{2}}=3.50 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$

A major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election (in terms of the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate). They intend to use a 95% confidence interval with margin of error of no more than 2.5%. What is the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal?

A) 2048
B) 1000
C) 39
D) 1536
E) 2000
F) 40
G) 1024
H) 1537
I) 4096
J) 500 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the minimum sample size needed, we can use the formula for the margin of error (ME) of a confidence interval:

ME = (Z * σ) / √n

where:
- ME is the margin of error (2.5% in this case, or 0.025 as a decimal)
- Z is the Z-score corresponding to the desired confidence level (95% in this case, which corresponds to a Z-score of approximately 1.96)
- σ is the population standard deviation (not given, but we can assume it's unknown and use the formula for the sample size that doesn't require it)
- n is the sample size

Rearranging the formula to solve for n, we get:

n = (Z * σ / ME)^2

However, since we don't know the population standard deviation (σ), we can use the formula for the sample size that doesn't require it:

n = (Z^2 * p * (1-p)) / ME^2

where:
- p is the population proportion (not given, but we can assume it's unknown and use the formula for the sample size that doesn't require it)

Since we don't know the population proportion (p), we can use the maximum possible value for p, which is 0.5 (since the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate can't be more than 50%).

Plugging in the values, we get:

n = (1.96^2 * 0.5 * (1-0.5)) / 0.025^2
= (3.8416 * 0.25) / 0.000625
= 0.9604 / 0.000625
= 1536

So, the minimum sample size needed to accomplish this goal is 1536.

<pre> The amount of money available for retirement is given by the formula $A=\int_{0}^{40} k e^{r t} d t$. We want to find $k$ so that $A=1,000,000$. We have that \begin{align*}
A & =\int_{0}^{40} k e^{r t} d t \\
& =k \int_{0}^{40} e^{r t} d t \\
& =k \cdot \frac{1}{r}\left[e^{r t}\right]_{0}^{40} \\
& =\frac{k}{r}\left(e^{40 r}-1\right).
\end{align*}We want to find $k$ so that $A=1,000,000$, so we have that \begin{align*}
1,000,000 & =\frac{k}{r}\left(e^{40 r}-1\right) \\
\Rightarrow\qquad k & =\frac{1,000,000 r}{e^{40 r}-1}.
\end{align*}Plugging in $r=0.075$, we have that \begin{align*}
k & =\frac{1,000,000(0.075)}{e^{40(0.075)}-1} \\
& =\frac{75,000}{e^{3}-1} \\
& \approx \frac{75,000}{20.0855} \\
& \approx 3750.
\end{align*}Thus, the answer is $\boxed{\text{C}}$.

The uncertainty principle states that the product of the uncertainty in energy (ΔE) and the uncertainty in time (Δt) is greater than or equal to the reduced Planck constant (ℏ):

ΔE × Δt ≥ ℏ

We can rearrange this equation to solve for Δt:

Δt ≥ ℏ / ΔE

Plugging in the values, we get:

Δt ≥ (1.0545718 × 10^-34 J s) / (10^-20 J)

Δt ≥ 1.0545718 × 10^-14 s

Rounding to two significant figures, we get:

Δt ≥ 1.1 × 10^-14 s

This is the minimum time required to measure the energy to a precision of 1 percent. However, this is not an option. We need to find the closest option.

The closest option is G) 1.1 × 10^-14 s.

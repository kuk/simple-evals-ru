###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: kiwis, pears, peaches, loquats, and apples. The loquats are more expensive than the kiwis. The pears are more expensive than the peaches. The apples are more expensive than the loquats. The apples are less expensive than the peaches.
Options:
(A) The kiwis are the second-cheapest
(B) The pears are the second-cheapest
(C) The peaches are the second-cheapest
(D) The loquats are the second-cheapest
(E) The apples are the second-cheapest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the second cheapest fruit out of the given options, let's analyze the cost relationships described:

1. Loquats are more expensive than Kiwis.
2. Pears are more expensive than Peaches.
3. Apples are more expensive than Loquats.
4. Apples are less expensive than Peaches.

From these statements, we can infer the following order of prices from cheapest to most expensive:

Kiwis -> Loquats -> Apples -> Peaches -> Apples 

To find the second cheapest fruit, we need to skip the cheapest fruit (Kiwis), and then take the next fruit in the order. Therefore, the second cheapest fruit is:

**Loquats**

So the answer is **(D) The loquats are the second-cheapest**. </pre>

### causal_judgement/48
###### instruction
<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a man who gets paid for pumping water into a cistern thereby replenishing the supply of drinking water in a nearby house. Unfortunately for the inhabitants of the house, the water that the man is pumping into the cistern today has been systematically contaminated with a lethal poison whose effects are unnoticeable until they can no longer be cured. Even though the man pumping the water had nothing to do with poisoning the water, he knows that the water has been poisoned. Nevertheless, the man pumps the water into the cistern knowing that it will poison and kill the inhabitants. But, he doesn't care at all about the inhabitants, he simply wants to do his job and get paid. Did the man intentionally poison the inhabitants?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think through this scenario step by step:

1. **The man knows the water is poisoned**: Despite not being responsible for the contamination itself, the man is fully aware that the water he is pumping into the cistern is poisoned.
2. **The man continues to pump the water**: Knowing full well that the water is poisoned and will lead to the deaths of the inhabitants, he proceeds to pump the water into the cistern.
3. **The man’s intentions**: His motivation is solely to complete his job and receive payment, without any regard for the consequences to the inhabitants.

Given these points, a typical person would likely conclude that although the man didn't initiate or directly cause the contamination, he knowingly participated in delivering the poisoned water, which led to the inhabitants' demise. Therefore, despite his lack of direct involvement in the contamination, he still intended the consequence of their deaths by continuing to pump the water.

So the answer is: **Yes**. </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Given a series of navigation instructions, determine whether one would end up back at the starting point.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn around. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Take 2 steps. Take 4 steps. Take 8 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 2 steps: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 4 steps: (0, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 8 steps: (0, 21), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 21) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn around. Take 6 steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (0, -1), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (0, -7), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Turn around: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (0, -1), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (0, 8), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Take 7 steps right.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take 2 steps. Turn right. Take 6 steps. Take 10 steps. Take 7 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the given instructions step by step:

1. **Starting Point**: We begin at the origin $(0, 0)$, facing north (the positive $y$-axis).
2. **Take 2 Steps**: Move to $(0, 2)$.
3. **Turn Right**: This turns us 90 degrees clockwise, so now we face east $(+x)$ direction.
4. **Take 6 Steps**: Move to $(6, 2)$.
5. **Take 10 Steps**: Move to $(6, 12)$.
6. **Take 7 Steps**: Move to $(13, 12)$.

At this point, we can see that our final position is $(13, 12)$, which is different from the starting point $(0, 0)$. Therefore, we have not returned to the starting point.

1. **Source Sentence**: "Liste der Naturschutzgebiete im Landkreis Augsburg"
   - This means "List of nature conservation areas in the district of Augsburg".

2. **Provided Translation**: "List of manure reserves in Augsburg"

3. **Comparison**:
   - The source sentence mentions "Naturschutzgebiete", which translates to "nature conservation areas" or "natural protected areas".
   - The provided translation uses "manure reserves," which does not match the concept of natural conservation areas.

4. **Error Type Identification**:
   - The term used in the translation completely changes the meaning of the original phrase. Instead of referring to areas designated for nature conservation, it refers to reserves of manure.
   - Therefore, the error belongs to the category of "Facts" because it introduces a trivial factual error not pertaining to entities, numerical values, modifiers, negation, or dropped content.

<pre> Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a station wagon, a minivan, and a truck. The minivan is newer than the truck. The station wagon is newer than the minivan.
Options:
(A) The station wagon is the oldest
(B) The minivan is the oldest
(C) The truck is the oldest

Let's think step by step.

1. The minivan is newer than the truck: "minivan > truck".
2. The station wagon is newer than the minivan: "station wagon > minivan".

Combining these two pieces of information, we can conclude that the station wagon is the newest among the three vehicles since it is newer than the minivan, which is already newer than the truck. 

Therefore, the order from oldest to newest is: truck, minivan, station wagon.

So, the correct answer is:
(C) The truck is the oldest </pre>

###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the statement step-by-step:

1. **Santi Cazorla** is a former professional footballer from Spain who primarily played as a midfielder. His career was mainly associated with clubs like Villarreal, Arsenal, and Sevilla but most prominently with Arsenal where he made over 300 appearances.

2. **Red Card**: In football, a red card is given to players for serious fouls or misconduct, resulting in their dismissal from the game. This typically happens during regular league matches, cup competitions (such as the UEFA Champions League), or other tournaments.

3. **UEFA Champions League Final**: The final match of this prestigious European club competition often features some of the world’s top teams and players. Incidents such as red cards are not uncommon in such high-stakes games.

Given these points, it is plausible that Santi Cazorla could have earned a red card if he committed a severe foul during the heat of the action in the Champions League Final.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are five vehicles: a minivan, a hatchback, a bus, a convertible, and a motorcyle. The hatchback is newer than the convertible. The bus is newer than the hatchback. The bus is older than the motorcyle. The minivan is the newest.
Options:
(A) The minivan is the third-newest
(B) The hatchback is the third-newest
(C) The bus is the third-newest
(D) The convertible is the third-newest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-newest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let’s analyze the given statements step by step:

1. **The hatchback is newer than the convertible**.
   - This means the convertible is older than the hatchback.
   
2. **The bus is newer than the hatchback**.
   - Therefore, the hatchback is older than the bus.

3. **The bus is older than the motorcycle**.
   - Consequently, the motorcycle is newer than the bus.

4. **The minivan is the newest**.
   - Hence, the minivan is newer than all other vehicles mentioned.

Combining these pieces of information, we can establish the order of the vehicles from oldest to newest: 
- Convertible (oldest)
- Hatchback
- Bus
- Motorcycle
- Minivan (newest)

Given this order, we need to identify which vehicle is the third-newest. Counting from the newest:

1. Minivan (newest)
2. Motorcycle
3. Bus

Therefore, the third-newest vehicle is the bus.

So, the correct answer is:
(C) The bus is the third-newest </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Wayne Rooney watched the pitch go by." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze this step-by-step:

1. **Wayne Rooney** is a former professional footballer who primarily played as a striker.
2. **Pitch** in baseball refers to the playing field. However, Wayne Rooney is known for his career in soccer (football).
3. In soccer, there is no concept of a "pitch" being something that moves or needs to be observed in this manner. The term usually refers to the entire field of play.
4. Soccer players might watch the ball during a game, but it wouldn’t typically be described with such wording.

Given these points, the sentence seems out of context and doesn't fit well within the typical language used in soccer. 

The final answer would be: No. </pre>

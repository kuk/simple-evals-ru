###### answer
<pre> Let $A = (-a, b)$, $B = (a, b)$, $C = (a, -b)$, and $D = (-a, -b)$, where $a$ and $b$ are positive real numbers. The center $O$ is at $(0, 0)$.
The condition $AB/AD = k$ implies that $2a / 2b = k$, so $a = kb$.

The distance from a point $(x, y)$ to the origin is $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$.
The distance from $(x, y)$ to $A$ is $\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + (y-b)^2}$.
The distance from $(x, y)$ to $B$ is $\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2}$.
The distance from $(x, y)$ to $C$ is $\sqrt{(x-a)^2 + (y+b)^2}$.
The distance from $(x, y)$ to $D$ is $\sqrt{(x+a)^2 + (y+b)^2}$.

We want to find the region where the distance to the origin is less than the distance to any of the vertices.
This means we need to satisfy the following inequalities:
$x^2 + y^2 < (x+a)^2 + (y-b)^2$
$x^2 + y^2 < (x-a)^2 + (y-b)^2$
$x^2 + y^2 < (x-a)^2 + (y+b)^2$
$x^2 + y^2 < (x+a)^2 + (y+b)^2$

These inequalities simplify to:
$x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0$
$x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 - 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax - 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0$
$x^2 + y^2 < x^2 - 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies -2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0$
$x^2 + y^2 < x^2 + 2ax + a^2 + y^2 + 2by + b^2 \implies 2ax + 2by + a^2 + b^2 > 0$

The region satisfying these inequalities is a smaller rectangle with vertices $(\pm a/2, \pm b/2)$.
The area of this smaller rectangle is $ab$.
The area of the original rectangle is $4ab$.
The probability is the ratio of the areas: $\frac{ab}{4ab} = \frac{1}{4}$.

Answer: $\frac{1}{4}$

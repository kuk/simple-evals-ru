Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig. Next, there is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. It follows that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's break down the argument step by step:

(1) Whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig: If X = NOT (half-brother(Steven)), then X = great-grandfather(Craig).

(2) There is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo: There exists X such that X = great-grandfather(Craig) AND (X = NOT ancestor(Jordon) OR X = NOT stepbrother(Gustavo)).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo? In other words, is it true that there exists at least one half-brother of Steven who is not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo?

Let's analyze the premises:

From (1), we know that if someone is not a half-brother of Steven, they are a great-grandfather of Craig.

From (2), we know there exists at least one individual who is a great-grandfather of Craig and either not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo.

To prove the hypothesis, we need to show that there is at least one half-brother of Steven who does not satisfy both conditions of being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

Given (2), we have an individual who is a great-grandfather of Craig and does not satisfy one of the conditions (ancestor of Jordon or stepbrother of Gustavo). Let's call this individual Y.

From (1), since Y is a great-grandfather of Craig, Y is not a half-brother of Steven.

However, the existence of Y does not directly prove anything about half-brothers of Steven. We need to connect this to half-brothers of Steven.

Let's consider the contrapositive of (1): If someone is not a great-grandfather of Craig, then they are a half-brother of Steven.

From (2), we know there is a Y who is a great-grandfather of Craig and does not satisfy both conditions. This Y is not a half-brother of Steven.

Now, let's consider a half-brother of Steven, call him Z. By (1), Z cannot be a great-grandfather of Craig.

Since Y (a great-grandfather of Craig) does not satisfy both conditions (ancestor of Jordon and stepbrother of Gustavo), and Z (a half-brother of Steven) cannot be a great-grandfather of Craig, we can conclude that Z (a half-brother of Steven) does not need to satisfy both conditions.

Therefore, the argument shows that there exists at least one half-brother of Steven (Z) who is not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

Thus, the argument is deductively valid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's break down the argument step by step:

(1) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{close friend of Francine}, \text{ then } X = \text{cousin of Samantha} \vee X = \text{ancestor of Janice} \vee X = \text{close friend of Shanika} \]

(2) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{close friend of Francine}, \text{ then } X = \text{cousin of Samantha} \]

(3) Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{close friend of Francine}, \text{ then } X = \text{close friend of Shanika} \]

Hypothesis: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{close friend of Francine}, \text{ then } X = \text{ancestor of Janice} \]

Let's analyze the logical flow:

From (2), we know that every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. This directly contradicts the necessity of being an ancestor of Janice for being a close friend of Francine, as (2) already specifies a different condition (cousin of Samantha) that is sufficient.

Furthermore, (3) states that being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. This does not provide any direct link to being an ancestor of Janice.

Given (1), (2), and (3), we can conclude that being an ancestor of Janice is not necessary for being a close friend of Francine because (2) already establishes a sufficient condition (cousin of Samantha) that does not involve being an ancestor of Janice.

Therefore, the argument is invalid.

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/248
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a quail, a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a falcon, an owl, and a blue jay. The blue jay is to the left of the falcon. The blue jay is the second from the right. The raven is to the left of the robin. The owl is the third from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The raven is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The quail is the third from the right
(B) The raven is the third from the right
(C) The hummingbird is the third from the right
(D) The robin is the third from the right
(E) The falcon is the third from the right
(F) The owl is the third from the right
(G) The blue jay is the third from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The blue jay is to the left of the falcon: "(left) ? blue jay ? falcon ? (right)".

(2) The blue jay is the second from the right: "(left) ? ? ? ? ? falcon blue jay (right)".

(3) The raven is to the left of the robin: "(left) ? raven ? robin ? (right)".

(4) The owl is the third from the right: "(left) ? ? ? owl ? ? ? (right)".

(5) The hummingbird is to the left of the quail: "(left) ? hummingbird ? quail ? (right)".

(6) The raven is the third from the left: "(left) ? ? raven ? ? ? ? (right)".

Now, let's combine these pieces of information:

From (2) and (4), we know the positions of the blue jay and the owl:
"(left) ? ? ? owl ? falcon blue jay (right)".

From (6), the raven is the third from the left, so:
"(left) ? ? raven ? owl ? falcon blue jay (right)".

From (3), the raven is to the left of the robin, so the robin must be the fourth from the left:
"(left) ? ? raven robin owl ? falcon blue jay (right)".

From (5), the hummingbird is to the left of the quail, and the only positions left are the first and second from the left. Since the raven is the third from the left, the hummingbird must be the first and the quail the second:
"(left) hummingbird quail raven robin owl falcon blue jay (right)".

Now, we can see that the quail is the third from the right.

So the answer is (A) The quail is the third from the right. </pre>

### snarks/22
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?
(B) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

If we look at (A), it asks if Knuth up arrow notation is not unfamiliar, implying that it is expected to be unfamiliar to the person being addressed. This suggests a mild surprise or disbelief that the person is already familiar with such a complex mathematical notation, which can be interpreted as a subtle form of sarcasm, highlighting the complexity or rarity of the subject.

If we look at (B), it asks if Knuth up arrow notation is not normal for you, implying that it is expected to be normal or common. This statement is more straightforward and lacks the element of surprise or disbelief that would indicate sarcasm. It simply questions the familiarity of the notation in a more neutral or direct manner.

Given the context and the nuances of sarcasm, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A). </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a sedan, a minivan, a motorcyle, a limousine, a hatchback, a truck, and a tractor. The motorcyle is older than the tractor. The hatchback is older than the limousine. The hatchback is newer than the truck. The truck is newer than the tractor. The minivan is the second-newest. The sedan is the third-newest.
Options:
(A) The sedan is the oldest
(B) The minivan is the oldest
(C) The motorcyle is the oldest
(D) The limousine is the oldest
(E) The hatchback is the oldest
(F) The truck is the oldest
(G) The tractor is the oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The motorcycle is older than the tractor: "motorcycle > tractor".

(2) The hatchback is older than the limousine: "hatchback > limousine".

(3) The hatchback is newer than the truck: "truck > hatchback".

(4) The truck is newer than the tractor: "truck > tractor".

(5) The minivan is the second-newest.

(6) The sedan is the third-newest.

From (1) and (4), we know: motorcycle > tractor &lt; truck.

From (3) and (4), we know: motorcycle > tractor &lt; truck &lt; hatchback.

From (2), we know: motorcycle > tractor &lt; truck &lt; hatchback > limousine.

Now, let's place the minivan and sedan according to (5) and (6):

(5) The minivan is the second-newest, so it must be newer than the sedan but older than the newest vehicle.

(6) The sedan is the third-newest, so it must be older than the minivan but newer than the fourth-newest vehicle.

Given the existing order, the newest vehicle must be the motorcycle (since it's older than the tractor but not specified to be newer than anything else). 

So, the order from oldest to newest is:

1. Tractor
2. Limousine
3. Hatchback
4. Truck
5. Sedan
6. Minivan
7. Motorcycle

Therefore, the tractor is the oldest vehicle.

The answer is (G) The tractor is the oldest. </pre>

### disambiguation_qa/100
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.
Options:
(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
(B) The receptionist was in a good mood
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

In this sentence, the pronoun "she" needs to be identified in terms of its antecedent. The possible antecedents are "the mechanic" and "the receptionist." The context provided by the verb "greetings" and the reason "because she was in a good mood" can help us determine the most likely referent.

1. **Considering "the mechanic" as "she":** "The mechanic greets the receptionist because the mechanic was in a good mood." This scenario makes logical sense. It is common for someone to greet another person because they are in a good mood.

2. **Considering "the receptionist" as "she":** "The mechanic greets the receptionist because the receptionist was in a good mood." This scenario is less likely because the reason for the mechanic's action (greeting) is attributed to the receptionist's mood, which is not a direct cause for the mechanic's action.

Given the context, the most logical interpretation is that the mechanic's action (greeting) is motivated by her own mood. Therefore, the antecedent of "she" is most likely "the mechanic."

So, the answer is (A) The mechanic was in a good mood. </pre>

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's break down the premises and the conclusion to determine the validity of the argument.

(1) First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.
- This can be represented as: If X = brother(Edward), then X = nephew(Henry).

(2) Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.
- This can be represented as: There exists an X such that X = ancestor(Carlos) AND X = workmate(Efrain) AND X = nephew(Henry).

(3) Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.
- This can be represented as: If X = brother(Edward), then X = workmate(Efrain).

Hypothesis: Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.
- This can be represented as: There exists an X such that X = ancestor(Carlos) AND X = brother(Edward).

Let's see if the hypothesis can be deduced from the premises:

From (1), we know that if someone is a brother of Edward, they must also be a nephew of Henry.

From (2), we know there exists someone who is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry.

From (3), we know that if someone is a brother of Edward, they are also a workmate of Efrain.

To prove the hypothesis, we need to show that there exists someone who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.

From (2), we have someone who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain. By (1), being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward, so this person could potentially be a brother of Edward.

However, (3) only tells us that being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain, not that every workmate of Efrain is a brother of Edward.

Therefore, while we know there is someone who is an ancestor of Carlos and a nephew of Henry (and thus potentially a brother of Edward), we cannot conclusively deduce from the given premises that this person is indeed a brother of Edward.

The argument does not provide enough information to conclude that someone is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.

So the answer is invalid. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, we are told that an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address whenever two people are logged in at the same time. Both Alice and Zoe log in at 9 am, which triggers the sending of the email. A typical person would understand that the action of both individuals logging in simultaneously is what caused the email to be sent. Since Zoe's action of logging in at the same time as Alice is a necessary part of the condition that triggers the email, a typical person would conclude that Zoe's action contributed to the cause of the email being sent. Therefore, the answer is Yes, Zoe caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. </pre>

The limousine is older than the motorcyle. The truck is newer than the motorcyle. The sedan is the second-newest. The tractor is newer than the convertible. The hatchback is older than the convertible.
Options:
(A) The convertible is the third-oldest
(B) The truck is the third-oldest
(C) The tractor is the third-oldest
(D) The limousine is the third-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-oldest
(F) The hatchback is the third-oldest
(G) The sedan is the third-oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The hatchback is the fourth-newest: This means there are three vehicles newer than the hatchback.

(2) The sedan is the second-newest: This means the sedan is newer than all but one vehicle.

(3) The hatchback is older than the convertible: This places the convertible as one of the three vehicles newer than the hatchback.

(4) The tractor is newer than the convertible: This places the tractor as one of the two vehicles newer than the sedan.

(5) The limousine is older than the motorcycle: This means the motorcycle is newer than the limousine.

(6) The truck is newer than the motorcycle: This places the truck as the newest vehicle.

From these statements, we can deduce the following order from newest to oldest:

(1) Truck (newest)
(2) Sedan (second-newest)
(3) Convertible (since the hatchback is fourth-newest and older than the convertible)
(4) Hatchback (fourth-newest)
(5) Tractor (newer than the convertible but not as new as the sedan)
(6) Motorcycle (older than the truck and newer than the limousine)
(7) Limousine (oldest)

Therefore, the third-oldest vehicle is the motorcycle.

The motorcycle is the third-oldest. So the answer is (E). </pre>

### formal_fallacies/30
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach. Now, being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach. Moreover, nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC. All this entails that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's break down the argument step by step:

(1) Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{opponent(FC Dnipro)}, \text{ then } X = \text{opponent(West Ham United FC)} \text{ OR } X = \text{expert(SCR Altach)} \]

(2) Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{NOT expert(SCR Altach)}, \text{ then } X = \text{backer(Chelsea FC)} \]

(3) Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC:
\[ \text{If } X = \text{NOT opponent(West Ham United FC)}, \text{ then } X = \text{backer(Chelsea FC)} \]
\[ \text{If } X = \text{NOT backer(Chelsea FC)}, \text{ then } X = \text{opponent(West Ham United FC)} \]

Hypothesis: Does it follow that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro?
\[ \text{If } X = \text{opponent(FC Dnipro)}, \text{ then } X = \text{backer(Chelsea FC)} \]

Let's analyze the logical flow:

From (1), if \( X \) is an opponent to FC Dnipro, then \( X \) is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.

From (2), if \( X \) is not an expert of SCR Altach, then \( X \) must be a backer of Chelsea FC.

From (3), if \( X \) is not an opponent to West Ham United FC, then \( X \) must be a backer of Chelsea FC.

Now, let's consider the two cases from (1):

- If \( X \) is an opponent to West Ham United FC, then by (3), \( X \) cannot be a backer of Chelsea FC. However, this does not directly lead to a conclusion about being a backer of Chelsea FC being necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.

- If \( X \) is an expert of SCR Altach, then by (2), \( X \) cannot be a backer of Chelsea FC. This also does not directly lead to the conclusion.

The key issue is that (1) does not directly link being an opponent to FC Dnipro to being a backer of Chelsea FC. The premises do not establish a necessary connection between being an opponent to FC Dnipro and being a backer of Chelsea FC.

Therefore, the argument does not logically deduce the hypothesis from the given premises.

So the answer is **invalid**. </pre>

<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: mangoes, kiwis, plums, pears, and watermelons. The kiwis are less expensive than the plums. The pears are the third-most expensive. The kiwis are the second-cheapest. The watermelons are the most expensive.
Options:
(A) The mangoes are the second-most expensive
(B) The kiwis are the second-most expensive
(C) The plums are the second-most expensive
(D) The pears are the second-most expensive
(E) The watermelons are the second-most expensive </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The kiwis are less expensive than the plums: "(cheapest) kiwis &lt; plums".
(2) The kiwis are the second-cheapest: "(cheapest) ? kiwis &lt; ?".
(3) The pears are the third-most expensive: "(most expensive) ? ? pears ? ?".
(4) The watermelons are the most expensive: "(most expensive) watermelons".

From (2), we know that there is only one fruit cheaper than kiwis. Let's denote this unknown fruit as X. So, the order from cheapest to most expensive starts as: X, kiwis.

From (1), we know that plums are more expensive than kiwis, so the order now looks like: X, kiwis, plums.

From (3), pears are the third-most expensive, which means there are two fruits more expensive than pears. Since watermelons are the most expensive (from (4)), the order now looks like: X, kiwis, plums, pears, watermelons.

Since watermelons are the most expensive, and pears are the third-most expensive, the only positions left for the mangoes are second or fourth. But pears are the third, so mangoes must be the second-most expensive.

Therefore, the order is: X, mangoes, kiwis, plums, pears, watermelons.

Since X is the cheapest and kiwis are the second-cheapest, X must be the mangoes.

So the final order is: mangoes, kiwis, plums, pears, watermelons.

The mangoes are the second-most expensive. So the answer is (A). </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the SVG path element:

This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.

(1) M 45.54,32.15: Move the current point to 45.54,32.15.

(2) L 60.29,36.81: Create a line from 45.54,32.15 to 60.29,36.81.

(3) L 58.87,43.07: Create a line from 60.29,36.81 to 58.87,43.07.

(4) L 53.01,45.70: Create a line from 58.87,43.07 to 53.01,45.70.

(5) L 45.54,32.15: Create a line from 53.01,45.70 back to 45.54,32.15.

This SVG path starts at point 45.54,32.15, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns to its starting point, thereby forming a five-sided polygon.

Now, let's determine the type of the five-sided polygon:

- **Pentagon**: A general five-sided polygon.

- **Kite**: A special case of a quadrilateral, not applicable here.

- **Other shapes**: None of the other options (circle, heptagon, hexagon, octagon, rectangle, sector, triangle) match a five-sided polygon.

Since the shape is a five-sided polygon and there are no specific properties (like equal sides or right angles) that would classify it as a special type of pentagon, the most accurate answer is:

(G) pentagon </pre>

### formal_fallacies/117
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove)?

Let's analyze the logical structure:

- The premise states that being a frequent consumer of Dove soap guarantees ownership of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. This is a sufficient condition, not a necessary one.

- The hypothesis, however, suggests a necessary condition: that ownership of a Bumble and bumble shampoo guarantees being a frequent consumer of Dove soap.

- The relationship between sufficient and necessary conditions is not interchangeable. Just because a condition is sufficient does not mean it is necessary.

- Therefore, the argument does not logically follow from the given premise.

So the answer is invalid. </pre>

###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

- The Fugitive (action, crime, thriller; 1993)
- Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (family, fantasy, musical; 1971)
- So I Married an Axe Murderer (comedy, drama; 1993)

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'batman begins'?
Options:
(A) barman begins
(B) batman bewins
(C) hatman begins
(D) batman begin </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

The original name is "Batman Begins". This is the title of a 2005 superhero film directed by Christopher Nolan, marking the beginning of the Dark Knight trilogy.

(A) "barman begins": Here, "batman" is changed to "barman". This is a humorous edit because "barman" refers to a bartender, which is a comically mundane and unexpected transformation of the superhero character Batman.

(B) "batman bewins": Here, "begins" is misspelled as "bewins". This is a typo and does not carry any humorous or meaningful transformation of the original title.

(C) "hatman begins": Here, "batman" is changed to "hatman". While it's a playful change, it doesn't carry the same level of humor or unexpectedness as "barman" does, as "hatman" doesn't evoke a clear, humorous image or context.

(D) "batman begin": Here, "begins" is changed to "begin". This is a grammatical error and does not add humor or a meaningful twist to the title.

Among the options, (A) "barman begins" is the most humorous and meaningful edit, as it transforms the superhero into a character from a completely different context, making it the funniest and most impactful change.

So the answer is (A). </pre>

- Aladdin (animation, adventure, musical; 1992)
- The Lion King (animation, adventure, musical; 1994)

These movies span across genres but are all highly acclaimed and have a significant impact on their respective genres. Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption are known for their storytelling and depth, while Aladdin and The Lion King are celebrated animated films. Among the options:

(A) Terminator 2 Judgment Day (action, science fiction; 1991) - While a classic, it doesn't fit the thematic or genre diversity.

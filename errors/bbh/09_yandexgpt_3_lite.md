Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'die another day'?
Options:
(A) die anothpr day
(B) diet another day
(C) dies another day
(D) die another ay </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

The original name is «Die Another Day». This is the title of a James Bond film.

(A) «die anothpr day»: here, «another» is replaced by «anothpr», which is not a word.

 (B) «diet another day»: «die» is replaced with «diet», but «diet» means a temporary reduction in the amount of food or drink one eats or drinks, so it does not fit the original title.

  (C) «dies another day»: this is a grammatical error, as «dies» is the third person singular present tense of «to die», and «another day» is a phrase used to indicate that something happens regularly or repeatedly, but it does not ruin the original name.

    (D) «die another ay»: «day» is replaced here by «ay», which sounds like «another», but is not an actual word.

Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A)

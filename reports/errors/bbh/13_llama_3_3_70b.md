### logical_deduction_seven_objects/187
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a convertible, a truck, a tractor, a limousine, a motorcyle, a hatchback, and a sedan. The hatchback is the fourth-newest. The limousine is older than the motorcyle. The truck is newer than the motorcyle. The sedan is the second-newest. The tractor is newer than the convertible. The hatchback is older than the convertible.
Options:
(A) The convertible is the third-oldest
(B) The truck is the third-oldest
(C) The tractor is the third-oldest
(D) The limousine is the third-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-oldest
(F) The hatchback is the third-oldest
(G) The sedan is the third-oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The hatchback is the fourth-newest.
2. The limousine is older than the motorcycle.
3. The truck is newer than the motorcycle.
4. The sedan is the second-newest.
5. The tractor is newer than the convertible.
6. The hatchback is older than the convertible.

From (1), we know the order of newness for the hatchback but not its absolute position yet.

From (4), the sedan is the second-newest, which means there is one vehicle newer than it, and since the hatchback is the fourth-newest, there must be two vehicles newer than the hatchback and older than the sedan.

From (2) and (3), we know the limousine is older than the motorcycle, and the truck is newer than the motorcycle. This gives us a partial order: limousine -> motorcycle -> truck.

From (5), the tractor is newer than the convertible, and from (6), the hatchback is older than the convertible. This means the convertible is the oldest.

Given that the hatchback is the fourth-newest and older than the convertible, and knowing the sedan is the second-newest, we can start building the order from newest to oldest:

1. Newest (unknown)
2. Sedan (second-newest)
3.? (third-newest)
4. Hatchback (fourth-newest)
5.? (fifth-newest)
6.? (sixth-newest)
7. Convertible (oldest)

Since the truck is newer than the motorcycle, and the limousine is older than the motorcycle, but we don't know their exact positions relative to the hatchback and sedan yet, let's incorporate the information about the tractor and convertible:

- The tractor is newer than the convertible, and the hatchback is older than the convertible. This means the tractor cannot be the oldest, and since the convertible is the oldest, the tractor must fit somewhere above the convertible but below the hatchback in terms of newness.

Given the sedan is the second-newest, and we need to find the third-oldest vehicle, let's try to place the vehicles in order from oldest to newest based on the clues:

1. Convertible (oldest)
2.? (second-oldest)
3.? (third-oldest)
4. Hatchback (fourth-newest, which means third-oldest from the bottom)
5.? (fifth-newest, or second-oldest from the bottom)
6.? (sixth-newest, or oldest from the top, excluding the two newest)
7.? (newest and second-newest)

From the clues:
- Limousine is older than the motorcycle.
- Truck is newer than the motorcycle.
- Tractor is newer than the convertible.
- Hatchback is older than the convertible.

So, we have:
- Convertible as the oldest.
- Since the hatchback is the fourth-newest, it's the third-oldest from the bottom. The limousine and motorcycle's order is known, but not their exact positions. The tractor is newer than the convertible but must be older than the hatchback since the hatchback is fourth-newest.

Let's place what we know:
1. Convertible
2. Limousine (since it's older than the motorcycle)
3. Motorcycle (because it's older than the truck and newer than the limousine, but we need to fit in the tractor and hatchback)
4. Tractor (newer than the convertible, and has to fit before the hatchback since the hatchback is fourth-newest)
5. Hatchback
6. Truck (newer than the motorcycle)
7. Sedan (second-newest), and the newest vehicle isn't specified but must be newer than the sedan.

However, this leaves us without a clear "newest" vehicle, but we can deduce the order for the oldest vehicles:
1. Convertible
2. Limousine
3. Motorcycle

Thus, the motorcycle is the third-oldest.

The correct answer is (E) The motorcycle is the third-oldest. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/158
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step:

(1) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha) OR X = ancestor(Janice) OR X = close-friend(Shanika).

(2) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha).

(3) Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = close-friend(Shanika).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = ancestor(Janice)?

From (2), we know that every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. This means that the condition "X = cousin(Samantha)" is already satisfied for all close friends of Francine.

From (3), we know that being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. This means that the condition "X = close-friend(Shanika)" is also satisfied for all close friends of Francine.

Now, let's look at the first premise (1) again. Since every close friend of Francine is already a cousin of Samantha (by premise 2) and a close friend of Shanika (by premise 3), the condition "X = ancestor(Janice)" is not necessarily required to satisfy the first premise.

In other words, the first premise is already satisfied by the conditions "X = cousin(Samantha)" and "X = close-friend(Shanika)", which are guaranteed by premises (2) and (3), respectively. Therefore, being an ancestor of Janice is not necessarily required for being a close friend of Francine.

So, the answer is: invalid.

The argument is trying to conclude that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine, but the premises do not provide sufficient evidence to support this conclusion. The conditions "X = cousin(Samantha)" and "X = close-friend(Shanika)" are already sufficient to satisfy the first premise, making the condition "X = ancestor(Janice)" unnecessary. </pre>

Q: Find a movie similar to Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Matrix, Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope, Inception:
Options:
(A) Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!
(B) Up
(C) Ernest Rides Again
(D) White Christmas </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to the given list, let's analyze the genres and themes of the movies listed:

- Raiders of the Lost Ark (action, adventure; 1981)
- The Matrix (action, science-fiction; 1999)
- Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (action, adventure, fantasy; 1977)
- Inception (action, science-fiction, thriller; 2010)

These movies are all highly acclaimed, action-packed, and have elements of adventure, science fiction, or fantasy. They are considered classics or highly influential in their respective genres.

Among the options provided:
(A) Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! (comedy, horror, science-fiction; 1978) - While it has a science-fiction element, it's more of a comedy and doesn't match the action-adventure theme of the listed movies.
(B) Up (animation, adventure, comedy; 2009) - Although it's an adventure, it's primarily an animated film and doesn't fit the action-science fiction theme.
(C) Ernest Rides Again (comedy, family; 1993) - This is a comedy and doesn't align with the genres of the listed movies.
(D) White Christmas (comedy, musical, romance; 1954) - This is a classic musical and doesn't fit the action-adventure or science-fiction genres.

None of the provided options directly match the themes and genres of the listed movies. However, if we were to choose based on the need for a movie that at least touches on adventure or science fiction, (A) Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! would be the closest, despite its comedic nature. But given the context, it seems there might not be a perfect match in the options provided for the specific blend of action, adventure, and science fiction represented by the listed movies.

Given the constraints and looking for the closest in terms of genre and theme, the answer would be (A), but it's essential to note that Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! is quite different in tone and style from the movies listed. In a real scenario, a more fitting recommendation would be a movie like "Back to the Future" or another sci-fi/adventure film, but such options are not provided here. </pre>

<pre> Given a series of navigation instructions, determine whether one would end up back at the starting point.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn around. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Take 2 steps. Take 4 steps. Take 8 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 2 steps: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 4 steps: (0, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 8 steps: (0, 21), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 21) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn around. Take 6 steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step.
Options:

A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (0, -1), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (0, -7), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Turn around: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (0, -1), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (0, 8), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Take 7 steps right.
Options:

A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 6 steps backward. Take 8 steps left. Take 3 steps right. Take 7 steps forward. Take 3 steps right. Take 9 steps right. Take 1 step backward. Take 7 steps left.
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis (since "always face forward" implies we're moving in the direction we're facing, and the default direction is often considered to be forward along the positive x-axis, but the problem doesn't specify the initial direction. However, given the context of the instructions, we'll consider the initial direction to be along the positive x-axis for simplicity).

(1) Always face forward: This instruction doesn't change our position or direction, so we're still at (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.

(2) Take 6 steps backward: Moving backward means moving in the opposite direction of our facing, so we move 6 steps along the negative x-axis: (-6, 0).

(3) Take 8 steps left: Moving left means we turn 90 degrees to our left and move 8 steps along the negative y-axis (since we were facing the positive x-axis). Our new position is (-6, -8).

(4) Take 3 steps right: Moving right means we turn 90 degrees to our right from the direction we were last moving (which was along the negative y-axis), so we're now moving along the positive x-axis. We move 3 steps: (-6 + 3, -8) = (-3, -8).

(5) Take 7 steps forward: Since we last moved along the x-axis, "forward" now means continuing along the positive x-axis. We move 7 steps: (-3 + 7, -8) = (4, -8).

(6) Take 3 steps right: Again, moving right from the x-axis direction means moving along the positive y-axis (since we turn 90 degrees to our right). However, given the context, it seems we should interpret "right" and "left" relative to our current direction of movement. Since we were moving forward (along the x-axis), moving right actually means moving along the positive y-axis, but in this step-by-step analysis, we need to correct our understanding based on standard navigation rules. So, moving 3 steps to the "right" after moving forward along the x-axis actually means moving along the positive y-axis, but since we're considering movements in a 2D plane relative to our current direction, the correct interpretation should be that after moving forward, "right" would indeed mean moving along the positive y-axis, correcting our position to (4, -8 + 3) = (4, -5).

(7) Take 9 steps right: Following the same logic as before, moving right again means moving further along the positive y-axis: (4, -5 + 9) = (4, 4).

(8) Take 1 step backward: Moving backward from the y-axis direction means moving along the negative y-axis: (4, 4 - 1) = (4, 3).

(9) Take 7 steps left: Moving left from the y-axis direction means moving along the negative x-axis: (4 - 7, 3) = (-3, 3).

Since (-3, 3) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The central computer is set up to send an empty email to a non-existent email address if two people are logged in at the same time.
2. **Identifying the Cause**: The cause of the empty email being sent is the simultaneous login of two users.
3. **Zoe's Action**: Zoe logs in at 9 am, which is the same time Alice logs in.
4. **Causal Attribution**: The question is whether Zoe caused the empty email to be sent. Given that the email is sent because two people are logged in simultaneously, and Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am contributes to this condition being met, a typical person would likely consider Zoe's action as part of the cause.

However, it's also important to consider that Alice's login at 9 am is equally necessary for the condition to be met. If either Alice or Zoe had logged in at a different time, the email would not have been sent.

5. **Conclusion**: Since Zoe's action (logging in at 9 am) is a necessary part of the condition that leads to the email being sent, and considering that causation in such scenarios often involves multiple contributing factors, a typical person might reason that Zoe did contribute to the cause of the email being sent. However, it's a matter of interpretation whether one considers this a sole cause or a contributing cause, given that Alice's action is equally necessary.

Given the options provided and considering typical reasoning about causation in scenarios involving multiple necessary conditions, the answer would likely be **Yes**, as Zoe's action is a necessary part of the sequence that leads to the email being sent, even though it's not the sole cause. </pre>

Q: Find a movie similar to The Fugitive, Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, So I Married an Axe Murderer, Batman:
Options:
(A) Seven
(B) Meet the Spartans
(C) Leprechaun 4 In Space
(D) Harlem Nights </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to the given list, let's analyze the genres and themes of the listed movies:

- The Fugitive (action, crime, drama; 1993)
- Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory (family, fantasy, musical; 1971)
- So I Married an Axe Murderer (comedy, romance; 1993)
- Batman (action, adventure; 1989)

These movies are a mix of action, comedy, and family-friendly genres, all of which are well-known and were produced before the year 2000. Among the options provided:

(A) Seven (crime, drama, mystery; 1995) - While it's a well-known movie from the same era, it's much darker than the others listed.
(B) Meet the Spartans (comedy; 2008) - This is a parody film, which might align with the comedic aspect of "So I Married an Axe Murderer," but it's more recent and doesn't match the broader range of genres represented.
(C) Leprechaun 4 In Space (comedy, horror, science-fiction; 1996) - This film combines comedy with other genres but is more niche and not as broadly recognized or acclaimed as the films listed.
(D) Harlem Nights (comedy, crime, drama; 1989) - This film, directed by and starring Eddie Murphy, combines comedy with drama and crime elements, making it a potential match in terms of genre diversity and era.

Given the diversity of genres in the original list (action, comedy, family, fantasy), none of the options perfectly match the broad spectrum of genres and themes. However, considering the need to choose the closest based on the mix of genres and the era of production, Harlem Nights, with its blend of comedy, crime, and drama, might be the most similar in terms of attempting to appeal to a wide audience and being from a similar time period. Therefore, the answer could be (D) Harlem Nights, keeping in mind that it's a bit of a stretch due to the unique combination of genres in the original list. </pre>

(C) 12/14/2007
(D) 12/14/1937
(E) 07/14/1938
(F) 12/14/1988
A: Let's think step by step.
If today is Christmas Eve of 1937, then today's date is December 24, 1937. 10 days before today is December 14, 1937, that is 12/14/1937. So the answer is (D).

Q: Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?

(B) 11/11/2018
(C) 08/25/2018
(D) 11/02/2018
(E) 11/04/2018
A: Let's think step by step.
If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today is 11/11/2019. The date one year ago from today is 11/11/2018. So the answer is (B).

(C) 01/18/1961
(D) 10/14/1960
(E) 01/03/1982
(F) 12/03/1960
A: Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, then and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. The date tomorrow is Jan 3, 1963, that is 01/03/1963. So the answer is (B).

Q: Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:
(A) 02/26/1966
(B) 01/13/1966
(C) 02/02/1966
(D) 10/23/1966
(E) 02/23/1968
(F) 02/23/1966 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
If today is the second day of the third month of 1966, then today's date is March 2, 1966. One week ago from today would be February 25, 1966, but that option is not available. However, looking at the options provided, the closest to being one week before March 2, 1966, would be February 26, 1966, if we were considering a date close to but not exactly one week prior. Since none of the options directly match the exact calculation of one week before March 2, 1966 (which would be February 25, 1966), but given the choices, (A) 02/26/1966 is the closest in terms of being in the same month and year, and just one day off from the actual date one week prior. 

However, strictly following the logic without considering the exact match:
- Today is March 2, 1966.
- One week ago would be February 25, 1966, but since this option is not provided, we look for the closest in the given options.

Given the options and understanding the question asks for the date one week ago from today (March 2, 1966), the closest provided option that reflects a date in the past relative to March 2, 1966, and considering typical expectations for such a question, would indeed be (A) 02/26/1966, acknowledging the provided options do not include the exact date one week prior (February 25, 1966). 

So, the answer is (A). </pre>

### snarks/22
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you?
(B) You mean Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

If we look at (A), it says that Knuth up arrow notation isn't unfamiliar for you, implying that it is expected that the person is familiar with it. The use of "unfamiliar" in a negative sentence structure ("isn't unfamiliar") suggests that the speaker is being sarcastic, implying that the notation is actually obscure or specialized, and it's surprising that the person might be familiar with it.

If we look at (B), it says that Knuth up arrow notation isn't normal for you, implying that it is not typical or expected for the person to be familiar with it. This statement seems to be a genuine expression of surprise or inquiry, without any apparent irony or sarcasm.

Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A). 

The speaker in (A) seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying, which is a characteristic of sarcasm. The implication is that Knuth up arrow notation is indeed unfamiliar to most people, and the speaker is being facetious by suggesting that it's not unfamiliar to the person being addressed. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A lieutenant was talking with a sergeant. The lieutenant gave the order: 'Send your squad to the top of Thompson Hill.' The sergeant said: 'But if I send my squad to the top of Thompson Hill, we'll be moving the men directly into the enemy's line of fire. Some of them will surely be killed!' The lieutenant answered: 'Look, I know that they'll be in the line of fire, and I know that some of them will be killed. But I don't care at all about what happens to our soldiers. All I care about is taking control of Thompson Hill.' The squad was sent to the top of Thompson Hill. As expected, the soldiers were moved into the enemy's line of fire, and some of them were killed. Did the lieutenant intentionally put the soldiers in the line of fire?

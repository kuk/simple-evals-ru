Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 31.00,73.00 L 32.00,59.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 49.00,41.00 L 64.00,37.00 L 71.00,55.00 L 64.00,76.00 L 52.00,61.00 L 31.00,73.00"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 14.19,26.04 L 51.43,39.21 L 58.44,36.69 L 56.63,30.17 L 48.53,26.66 L 14.19,26.04"/> draws a

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 8 separate commands.
(1) M 64.00,63.00: Move the current point to 64.00,63.00.
(2) L 44.00,63.00: Create a line from 64.00,63.00 to 44.00,63.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 44.00,63.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 64.00,50.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 64.00,50.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 64.00,50.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 83.00,57.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 83.00,57.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 83.00,57.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 64.00,63.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 64.00,63.00.
This SVG path starts at point 64.00,63.00, creates seven consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (F). </pre>

### formal_fallacies/158
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine if it is deductively valid or invalid.

### Premises:
1. **Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika.**
   - If \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow (\text{cousin}(X, \text{Samantha}) \lor \text{ancestor}(X, \text{Janice}) \lor \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Shanika})) \)

2. **Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha.**

3. **Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.**
   - If \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) is a close friend of Shanika.

### Conclusion:
- **Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.**
  - If \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) is an ancestor of Janice.
  - Symbolically: \( \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow \text{ancestor}(X, \text{Janice}) \)

### Analysis:
1. From Premise 2, we know that if \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) is a cousin of Samantha.
   - \( \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow \text{cousin}(X, \text{Samantha}) \)

2. From Premise 3, we know that if \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) is a close friend of Shanika.
   - \( \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Shanika}) \)

3. From Premise 1, we know that if \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika.
   - \( \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow (\text{cousin}(X, \text{Samantha}) \lor \text{ancestor}(X, \text{Janice}) \lor \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Shanika})) \)

Given Premise 2, we already know that \( X \) is a cousin of Samantha if \( X \) is a close friend of Francine. Therefore, the disjunction in Premise 1 is satisfied by \( \text{cousin}(X, \text{Samantha}) \), making the other two conditions (\( \text{ancestor}(X, \text{Janice}) \) and \( \text{close-friend}(X, \text{Shanika}) \)) irrelevant for the truth of the disjunction.

However, the conclusion states that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. This means that if \( X \) is a close friend of Francine, then \( X \) must be an ancestor of Janice. But from Premise 2, we know that \( X \) is a cousin of Samantha, which does not necessarily imply that \( X \) is an ancestor of Janice.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **invalid** because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premises. The premises only guarantee that a close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha and a close friend of Shanika, but they do not guarantee that a close friend of Francine must be an ancestor of Janice.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, we are told that the circuit breaker will fail if four people turn on their lamps at the same time. We are also told that Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turned on their lamps at 8 PM, which resulted in the circuit breaker failing.

A typical person would consider the following points:
1. The circuit breaker fails when four people turn on their lamps simultaneously.
2. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turned on their lamps at 8 PM.
3. The circuit breaker failed because four people turned on their lamps at the same time.

Given these points, a typical person would recognize that each individual's action (turning on their lamp) was a necessary part of the condition that caused the circuit breaker to fail. Without any one of them turning on their lamp, the circuit breaker would not have failed.

Therefore, a typical person would conclude that Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM was a contributing cause to the circuit breaker failing. So the answer is Yes. </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Now, being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach. Moreover, nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC. All this entails that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine whether it is deductively valid or invalid.

### Premises:
1. **Premise 1:** Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.
   - Symbolically: \( \forall x (O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \rightarrow (O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \lor E(x, \text{SCR Altach}))) \)

2. **Premise 2:** Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach.
   - Symbolically: \( \forall x (\neg E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \rightarrow B(x, \text{Chelsea FC})) \)

3. **Premise 3:** Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC.
   - Symbolically: \( \forall x (\neg (O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \land B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}))) \)

### Conclusion:
- **Conclusion:** Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.
  - Symbolically: \( \forall x (O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \rightarrow B(x, \text{Chelsea FC})) \)

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Premise 1 Analysis:**
   - If \( x \) is an opponent to FC Dnipro, then \( x \) must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.
   - \( O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \rightarrow (O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \lor E(x, \text{SCR Altach})) \)

2. **Premise 2 Analysis:**
   - If \( x \) is not an expert of SCR Altach, then \( x \) must be a backer of Chelsea FC.
   - \( \neg E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \rightarrow B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \)

3. **Premise 3 Analysis:**
   - There is no \( x \) who is both an opponent to West Ham United FC and a backer of Chelsea FC.
   - \( \neg (O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \land B(x, \text{Chelsea FC})) \)

### Combining the Premises:

- **Case 1:** \( O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \)
  - From Premise 1: \( O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \rightarrow (O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \lor E(x, \text{SCR Altach})) \)
  - So, \( O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \lor E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \)

- **Subcase 1.1:** \( O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \)
  - From Premise 3: \( \neg (O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \land B(x, \text{Chelsea FC})) \)
  - Since \( O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \) is true, \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) must be false.
  - Therefore, \( \neg B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \)

- **Subcase 1.2:** \( E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \)
  - From Premise 2: \( \neg E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \rightarrow B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \)
  - Since \( E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \) is true, \( \neg E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \) is false.
  - Therefore, \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) can be either true or false, but we need to check consistency with other premises.

### Conclusion Verification:

- From Subcase 1.1, if \( O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \) is true, then \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) is false.
- From Subcase 1.2, if \( E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \) is true, \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) can be either true or false, but we need to ensure consistency with Premise 3.

- If \( O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \) is true, then \( O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \lor E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \) must be true.
- If \( O(x, \text{West Ham United FC}) \) is true, \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) is false.
- If \( E(x, \text{SCR Altach}) \) is true, \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) can be true or false, but if \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) is false, it contradicts the conclusion.

### Final Analysis:
- The conclusion \( O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \rightarrow B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) is not necessarily true given the premises. There are cases where \( O(x, \text{FC Dnipro}) \) can be true and \( B(x, \text{Chelsea FC}) \) can be false.

Therefore, the argument is **invalid**. </pre>

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, we are told that an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address if two people are logged in at the same time. Both Alice and Zoe logged in at 9 am, and as a result, the email was sent.

A typical person would consider the following points:
1. The email is sent when two people are logged in simultaneously.
2. Both Alice and Zoe logged in at the same time (9 am).
3. The email was sent immediately after both logged in.

Given these points, a typical person would conclude that the email was sent because both Alice and Zoe were logged in at the same time. Therefore, both Alice and Zoe contributed to the cause of the email being sent. However, the question specifically asks if Zoe caused the email to be sent.

Since the email was sent due to the simultaneous action of both Alice and Zoe, a typical person would likely say that Zoe did contribute to the cause, but it was the combined action of both that triggered the email. Therefore, the answer is:

- Yes

However, it's important to note that this is a nuanced situation, and some might argue that it was the combination of both actions that caused the email to be sent, rather than attributing it solely to Zoe. But in the context of the question, a typical person would likely say "Yes" because Zoe's action was a necessary part of the cause. </pre>

Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Options:
(A) midnigmht cowboy
(B) midnight cow boy
(C) midnights cowboy
(D) midnight cowbory </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
The original name is "midnight cowboy". This is the name of a classic American film from 1969.

(A) "midnigmht cowboy": Here the word "midnight" is changed to "midnigmht", but the word "midnigmht" is not an actual word. This change is arbitrary and not humorous.
(B) "midnight cow boy": Here the word "cowboy" is changed to "cow boy", which is a valid but less common way to write the word. While it changes the spelling, it doesn't add much humor.
(C) "midnights cowboy": Here the word "midnight" is changed to "midnights", but "midnights" is not a correct form of the word. This change is arbitrary and not humorous.
(D) "midnight cowbory": Here the word "cowboy" is changed to "cowbory", which is a playful and whimsical edit. The addition of "y" at the end makes it sound like a made-up or silly word, which can be humorous.

According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a quail, a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a falcon, an owl, and a blue jay. The blue jay is to the left of the falcon. The blue jay is the second from the right. The raven is to the left of the robin. The owl is the third from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The raven is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The quail is the third from the right
(B) The raven is the third from the right
(C) The hummingbird is the third from the right
(D) The robin is the third from the right
(E) The falcon is the third from the right
(F) The owl is the third from the right
(G) The blue jay is the third from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. **The blue jay is the second from the right:**
   - This means the blue jay is in the 6th position from the left.
   - The order so far: `? ? ? ? ? B ?`

2. **The blue jay is to the left of the falcon:**
   - Since the blue jay is in the 6th position, the falcon must be in the 7th position.
   - The order so far: `? ? ? ? ? B F`

3. **The owl is the third from the right:**
   - This means the owl is in the 5th position from the left.
   - The order so far: `? ? ? ? O B F`

4. **The raven is the third from the left:**
   - This means the raven is in the 3rd position from the left.
   - The order so far: `? ? R ? O B F`

5. **The raven is to the left of the robin:**
   - Since the raven is in the 3rd position, the robin must be in one of the positions to the right of the raven.
   - The only available positions to the right of the raven are the 4th and 7th positions. However, the 7th position is already occupied by the falcon.
   - Therefore, the robin must be in the 4th position.
   - The order so far: `? ? R H O B F`

6. **The hummingbird is to the left of the quail:**
   - The only remaining positions are the 1st and 2nd from the left.
   - Since the hummingbird must be to the left of the quail, the hummingbird must be in the 1st position and the quail in the 2nd position.
   - The final order: `H Q R H O B F`

Now, let's check the options:
- (A) The quail is the third from the right: False (Quail is in the 2nd position from the left).
- (B) The raven is the third from the right: False (Raven is in the 3rd position from the left).
- (C) The hummingbird is the third from the right: False (Hummingbird is in the 1st position from the left).
- (D) The robin is the third from the right: True (Robin is in the 4th position from the left, which is the 3rd from the right).
- (E) The falcon is the third from the right: False (Falcon is in the 7th position from the left).
- (F) The owl is the third from the right: True (Owl is in the 5th position from the left, which is the 3rd from the right).
- (G) The blue jay is the third from the right: False (Blue jay is in the 6th position from the left).

Both (D) and (F) are true, but since the question asks for the third from the right, the correct answer is:

**The robin is the third from the right. So the answer is (D).** </pre>

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig. Next, there is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. It follows that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine whether it is deductively valid or invalid.

### Premises:
1. **Premise 1:** Whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig.
   - Symbolically: If \( \neg \text{half-brother}(X, \text{Steven}) \), then \( \text{great-grandfather}(X, \text{Craig}) \).

2. **Premise 2:** There is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo.
   - Symbolically: There exists \( Y \) such that \( \text{great-grandfather}(Y, \text{Craig}) \) and \( \neg (\text{ancestor}(Y, \text{Jordon}) \land \text{stepbrother}(Y, \text{Gustavo})) \).

### Conclusion:
- **Conclusion:** Not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.
  - Symbolically: \( \neg \forall X (\text{half-brother}(X, \text{Steven}) \rightarrow (\text{ancestor}(X, \text{Jordon}) \land \text{stepbrother}(X, \text{Gustavo}))) \).

### Analysis:
1. **Premise 1** tells us that if someone is not a half-brother of Steven, then they must be a great-grandfather of Craig.
2. **Premise 2** tells us that there is at least one person who is a great-grandfather of Craig and is not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
- From **Premise 2**, we know there exists a person \( Y \) who is a great-grandfather of Craig and either:
  - \( Y \) is not an ancestor of Jordon, or
  - \( Y \) is not a stepbrother of Gustavo, or
  - Both of the above.

- If \( Y \) is a great-grandfather of Craig, then by **Premise 1**, \( Y \) cannot be a half-brother of Steven (because if \( Y \) were a half-brother of Steven, it would contradict the fact that \( Y \) is a great-grandfather of Craig).

- Therefore, \( Y \) is not a half-brother of Steven.

- Since \( Y \) is not a half-brother of Steven and \( Y \) is either not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo (or both), it follows that there is at least one person who is not a half-brother of Steven and is not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

- This means that not every half-brother of Steven can be both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo, because if they were, then there would be no such \( Y \) that satisfies **Premise 2**.

### Conclusion:
The argument is **valid** because the conclusion logically follows from the premises. The existence of a person \( Y \) who is a great-grandfather of Craig and not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo (as stated in **Premise 2**) implies that not every half-brother of Steven can be both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

So, the answer is **valid**. </pre>

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a convertible, a truck, a tractor, a limousine, a motorcyle, a hatchback, and a sedan. The hatchback is the fourth-newest. The limousine is older than the motorcyle. The truck is newer than the motorcyle. The sedan is the second-newest. The tractor is newer than the convertible. The hatchback is older than the convertible.
Options:
(A) The convertible is the third-oldest
(B) The truck is the third-oldest
(C) The tractor is the third-oldest
(D) The limousine is the third-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-oldest
(F) The hatchback is the third-oldest
(G) The sedan is the third-oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. **The hatchback is the fourth-newest.**
   - This means the hatchback is the fourth-oldest. So, the order so far is: (1) ? (2) ? (3) ? (4) hatchback ? (5) ? (6) ? (7) ?.

2. **The sedan is the second-newest.**
   - This means the sedan is the sixth-oldest. So, the order now is: (1) ? (2) ? (3) ? (4) hatchback ? (5) ? (6) sedan (7) ?.

3. **The limousine is older than the motorcycle.**
   - This means the limousine is to the left of the motorcycle in the order.

4. **The truck is newer than the motorcycle.**
   - This means the truck is to the right of the motorcycle in the order.

5. **The tractor is newer than the convertible.**
   - This means the tractor is to the right of the convertible in the order.

6. **The hatchback is older than the convertible.**
   - This means the convertible is to the right of the hatchback in the order.

Now, let's place the remaining vehicles in the order:

- Since the hatchback is the fourth-oldest, the convertible must be one of the three vehicles to the right of the hatchback.
- The tractor is newer than the convertible, so the tractor must be to the right of the convertible.
- The limousine is older than the motorcycle, and the truck is newer than the motorcycle, so the motorcycle must be between the limousine and the truck.
- The sedan is the sixth-oldest, so the seventh-oldest must be the remaining vehicle, which is the limousine.

So, the order is:
(1) ? (2) ? (3) ? (4) hatchback (5) convertible (6) sedan (7) limousine.

Now, we need to place the motorcycle and the truck:
- The motorcycle must be older than the truck.
- The motorcycle must be to the right of the limousine and to the left of the sedan.

The only possible positions for the motorcycle and the truck are:
(1) ? (2) ? (3) motorcycle (4) hatchback (5) convertible (6) sedan (7) limousine.
(1) ? (2) truck (3) motorcycle (4) hatchback (5) convertible (6) sedan (7) limousine.

Finally, we need to place the remaining vehicle, which is the tractor:
- The tractor is newer than the convertible, so it must be to the right of the convertible.
- The tractor must be to the left of the sedan.

The only possible position for the tractor is:
(1) ? (2) truck (3) motorcycle (4) hatchback (5) convertible (6) tractor (7) limousine.

Now, we need to place the remaining vehicle, which is the convertible:
- The convertible must be the third-oldest because it is to the right of the hatchback and to the left of the tractor.

So, the final order is:
(1) ? (2) truck (3) motorcycle (4) hatchback (5) convertible (6) tractor (7) limousine.

The third-oldest vehicle is the motorcycle. Therefore, the answer is (E) The motorcycle is the third-oldest. </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.

(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.

(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

(K) trapezoid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands, but it effectively forms a closed shape with 4 unique points.
(1) M 63.87,16.63: Move the current point to 63.87,16.63.
(2) L 66.66,42.93: Create a line from 63.87,16.63 to 66.66,42.93.
(3) L 38.28,45.94: Create a line from 66.66,42.93 to 38.28,45.94.
(4) L 35.49,19.64: Create a line from 38.28,45.94 to 35.49,19.64.
(5) M 35.49,19.64: Move the current point to 35.49,19.64 (this is redundant as the previous command already ended here).
(6) L 63.87,16.63: Create a line from 35.49,19.64 to 63.87,16.63, which closes the shape.

This SVG path starts at point 63.87,16.63, creates three consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "trapezoid" are the only four-sided polygons on the list. To determine which one is the correct answer, we need to check the properties of the shape.

A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a trapezoid has one pair of parallel sides.

Let's check the lengths of the sides:
- Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((66.66 - 63.87)^2 + (42.93 - 16.63)^2) = sqrt((2.79)^2 + (26.30)^2) = sqrt(7.78 + 691.69) = sqrt(700.47).
- Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((38.28 - 66.66)^2 + (45.94 - 42.93)^2) = sqrt((-28.38)^2 + (3.01)^2) = sqrt(805.42 + 9.06) = sqrt(814.48).
- Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((35.49 - 38.28)^2 + (19.64 - 45.94)^2) = sqrt((-2.79)^2 + (-26.30)^2) = sqrt(7.78 + 691.69) = sqrt(700.47).
- Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((63.87 - 35.49)^2 + (16.63 - 19.64)^2) = sqrt((28.38)^2 + (-3.01)^2) = sqrt(805.42 + 9.06) = sqrt(814.48).

We observe that |A| = |C| and |B| = |D|. This means the shape has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, which is a characteristic of a kite.

Therefore, the answer is (D) kite. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/39

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine whether it is deductively valid or invalid.

### Premises:
1. **First Premise:** Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.
   - This can be written as: If X is a brother of Edward, then X is a nephew of Henry.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry}) \).

2. **Second Premise:** Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.
   - This can be written as: There exists an X such that X is an ancestor of Carlos, X is a workmate of Efrain, and X is a nephew of Henry.
   - Symbolically: \( \exists X (\text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \land \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry})) \).

3. **Third Premise:** Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.
   - This can be written as: If X is a brother of Edward, then X is a workmate of Efrain.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \).

### Hypothesis:
- **Hypothesis:** Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.
  - Symbolically: \( \exists X (\text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward})) \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **From the Second Premise:**
   - We know there exists an X such that \( \text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \land \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry}) \).

2. **From the First Premise:**
   - If X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry}) \).

3. **From the Third Premise:**
   - If X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a workmate of Efrain.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \).

4. **Combining the Premises:**
   - We need to determine if there exists an X such that \( \text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \).

   - From the Second Premise, we have an X that is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry.
   - From the First Premise, we know that if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry.
   - From the Third Premise, we know that if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a workmate of Efrain.

   - Therefore, if X is a brother of Edward, X must satisfy all the conditions in the Second Premise (being an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Second Premise guarantees the existence of an X that is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry.
   - The First and Third Premises together imply that if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.
   - However, the Second Premise does not guarantee that the X who is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry is also a brother of Edward. It only states that such an X exists, but it does not provide a direct link to being a brother of Edward.

### Final Answer:
- The argument is **invalid** because the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward. The existence of an X who is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry does not guarantee that this X is also a brother of Edward. </pre>

The translation contains an error pertaining to
Options:
(A) Modifiers or Adjectives
(B) Numerical Values
(C) Negation or Antonyms
(D) Named Entities
(E) Dropped Content
(F) Facts </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. **Translate the Source Sentence:**
   - The correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is: "Schwechat is a town with 19,570 inhabitants southeast of Vienna, on the river Schwechat."

2. **Compare with the Provided Translation:**
   - The provided translation is: "Schwechat is a municipality on the dam Schwechat."

3. **Identify the Errors:**
   - **Named Entities:** The name "Schwechat" is correctly translated.
   - **Numerical Values:** The number of inhabitants (19,570) is omitted in the provided translation.
   - **Modifiers or Adjectives:** The description "town" is changed to "municipality," which is a minor change but not a significant error.
   - **Negation or Antonyms:** There is no negation or antonym introduced.
   - **Facts:** The location "southeast of Vienna" is omitted, and the river "Schwechat" is incorrectly described as a "dam."
   - **Dropped Content:** The number of inhabitants and the location relative to Vienna are significant details that are dropped in the provided translation.

4. **Determine the Most Significant Error:**
   - The most significant error is the omission of the number of inhabitants and the location relative to Vienna, which are crucial details in the original sentence.
   - Additionally, the river "Schwechat" is incorrectly described as a "dam," which is a factual error.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The translation contains an error pertaining to **Dropped Content** because it omits significant details from the original sentence.

So the answer is (E) Dropped Content. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/117
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step:

1. **Premise**: Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo.
   - This can be written as: If X is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, then X is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \rightarrow \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \).

2. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too.
   - This can be written as: If X is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo, then X is a frequent consumer of Dove soap.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \rightarrow \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \).

To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.

### Analysis:
- The premise states a one-way implication: \( \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \rightarrow \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \).
- The conclusion, however, states the reverse implication: \( \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \rightarrow \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \).

### Logical Implication:
- The premise tells us that if someone is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, then they must be an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. This does not imply that if someone is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo, they must be a frequent consumer of Dove soap.
- In other words, the premise only guarantees that all frequent consumers of Dove soap are owners of Bumble and bumble shampoo, but it does not guarantee that all owners of Bumble and bumble shampoo are frequent consumers of Dove soap.

### Example:
- Consider a person who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo but is not a frequent consumer of Dove soap. This person could still be an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo without being a frequent consumer of Dove soap, which does not contradict the premise.

### Conclusion:
- The argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise only establishes a one-way implication, while the conclusion incorrectly assumes a two-way implication.

So, the answer is **invalid**. </pre>

(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 7 separate commands.
(1) M 22.00,62.00: Move the current point to 22.00,62.00.
(2) L 46.00,65.00: Create a line from 22.00,62.00 to 46.00,65.00.
(3) L 64.00,60.00: Create a line from 46.00,65.00 to 64.00,60.00.
(4) L 91.00,42.00: Create a line from 64.00,60.00 to 91.00,42.00.
(5) L 92.00,24.00: Create a line from 91.00,42.00 to 92.00,24.00.
(6) L 46.00,19.00: Create a line from 92.00,24.00 to 46.00,19.00.
(7) L 22.00,62.00: Create a line from 46.00,19.00 to 22.00,62.00.
This SVG path starts at point 22.00,62.00, creates six consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating a seven-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "heptagon" is the only seven-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (B). </pre>

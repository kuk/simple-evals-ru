A doctor is charged with the murder of his wife. The prosecution alleges that he murdered his wife by giving her a massive injection of succinylcholine while she was asleep. Succinylcholine is a drug used in small quantities by anesthesiologists as a muscle relaxant. The prosecution claims that the fatal dose given to the wife so totally relaxed her lung muscles that she suffocated. During the trial, a toxicologist, who had no previous knowledge of the case, sat in court and heard all of the evidence about the wife's death and autopsy. As part of the doctor's defense, his attorney calls the toxicologist to give his opinion on the cause of the wife's death. May the toxicologist so testify?

A) No, because he did not directly examine the wife's body.
B) No, because the cause of death is an issue to be decided by the jury.
C) Yes, because an expert may base his opinion on facts made known to him at the trial.
D) Yes, because he has relevant experience in the field of toxicology.
E) No, because he has no personal knowledge of the wife's death.
F) Yes, because he can provide an unbiased perspective.
G) No, because he did not conduct the autopsy himself.
H) No, because his testimony might bias the jury.
I) Yes, because he can identify the data upon which his opinion is based.
J) Yes, because his professional expertise allows him to form a valid opinion. </pre>

A student is experimenting with a simple spring-block oscillator of spring constant k and amplitude A. The block attached to the spring has a mass of m. If the student places a small block of mass m on top of the original block, which of the following is true?

A) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is less than kA/[(M+m)g].
B) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(kA).
C) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum displacement from the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(kA).
D) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of kinetic friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(kA).
E) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].
F) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum velocity, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].
G) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at maximum velocity, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is less than (M+m)g/(kA).
H) The small block is most likely to slide off when the original block is at the equilibrium position, but will not slide off as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than (M+m)g/(2kA).
I) The small block will not slide off regardless of the position of the original block as long as the coefficient of static friction between the blocks is greater than kA/[(M+m)g].

 Which of the following claims would Leopold clearly accept?

A) The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment ultimately concern how human beings should treat each other.
B) We should think in terms of "the balance of nature" to properly appreciate the value of the natural environment.
C) The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems.
D) We should ignore all economic motives in deciding questions about land use. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> C) The problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems.

Leopold, as an environmentalist, would likely agree with the claim that the problems associated with how we should use our natural environment are not merely economic problems. This aligns with his philosophy of land ethics and his emphasis on the interconnectedness of all living things.

An oscillator which emits high frequency waves at 0.26 GHz is set up in front of a large plane metal reflector. Standing waves are formed with nodes 57.5 cm apart. Neglecting the refractive index of air, compute the velocity of light.

A) 5.98 × 10^10 cm/sec
B) 3.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
C) 3.00 × 10^10 cm/sec
D) 2.99 × 10^11 cm/sec
E) 2.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
F) 2.99 × 10^9 cm/sec
G) 1.49 × 10^10 cm/sec
H) 1.99 × 10^11 cm/sec
I) 1.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
J) 4.99 × 10^10 cm/sec </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The wavelength of the standing waves can be calculated using the formula:

$\lambda = 2d$,

where $\lambda$ is the wavelength and $d$ is the distance between the nodes.

We are given that the distance between the nodes is 57.5 cm, so the wavelength is:

$\lambda = 2 \times 57.5 = 115$ cm.

The velocity of light can be calculated using the formula:

$v = f \lambda$,

where $v$ is the velocity of light, $f$ is the frequency, and $\lambda$ is the wavelength.

We are given that the frequency of the oscillator is 0.26 GHz, so the velocity of light is:

$v = 0.26 \times 10^9 \times 115 = 2.99 \times 10^{10}$ cm/sec.

The mass of the Earth is 5.97 × 10^24 kg. The Moon, whose center is 3.84 × 10^8 m from the Earth’s center, has mass 7.35 × 10^22 kg. Which of the following is the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon?

A) 10^79 N
B) 10^19 N
C) 10^99 N
D) 10^59 N
E) 10^39 N
F) 10^89 N
G) 10^69 N
H) 10^9 N
I) 10^29 N
J) 10^49 N </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the gravitational force between two objects, we use the formula $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2 / \text{kg}^2$), $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers.

In this case, the mass of the Earth ($m_1$) is $5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}$, the mass of the Moon ($m_2$) is $7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}$, and the distance between their centers ($r$) is $3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}$.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$F = G \frac{5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \cdot 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}}{3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}^2} \approx 2.02 \times 10^{19} \, \text{N}$

Therefore, the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon is $10^{19} \, \text{N}$.

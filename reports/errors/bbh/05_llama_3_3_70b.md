Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig. Next, there is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. It follows that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion.

(1) Whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig: If X = NOT (half-brother(Steven)), then X = great-grandfather(Craig).

(2) There is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo: There exists X such that X = great-grandfather(Craig) AND X = NOT (ancestor(Jordon) AND stepbrother(Gustavo)).

Conclusion: Not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo: NOT (FOR ALL X, IF X = half-brother(Steven), THEN X = ancestor(Jordon) AND X = stepbrother(Gustavo)).

Let's analyze the argument step by step:

- From premise (1), if someone is not a half-brother of Steven, they are a great-grandfather of Craig.
- Premise (2) states there exists a person who is a great-grandfather of Craig and either not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. This implies there is at least one great-grandfather of Craig who does not meet both conditions of being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

To connect these premises to the conclusion, we must consider the relationship between being a half-brother of Steven and the conditions of being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

The conclusion claims that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo. To prove this conclusion is true based on the premises, we need to find a logical link that shows at least one half-brother of Steven does not meet both conditions (being an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo), or we must show that the premises logically lead to the conclusion that there is an exception among the half-brothers of Steven regarding these conditions.

However, premise (2) directly supports the conclusion by implying that there is someone who is a great-grandfather of Craig (and thus, by premise 1, not a half-brother of Steven) who is either not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. But this does not directly address the half-brothers of Steven. 

The critical insight is recognizing that if there were no half-brothers of Steven who were not both ancestors of Jordon and stepbrothers of Gustavo, then all great-grandfathers of Craig (who are not half-brothers of Steven) would have to be exceptions to this rule as stated in premise (2). However, premise (2) does not directly relate to half-brothers of Steven but rather to great-grandfathers of Craig. 

Given premise (1), if someone is a great-grandfather of Craig, they are not a half-brother of Steven. Premise (2) then tells us about a characteristic of some great-grandfathers of Craig (not being both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo), which indirectly supports the idea that not all individuals (including half-brothers of Steven, by extension) must be both ancestors of Jordon and stepbrothers of Gustavo, especially since the premise about great-grandfathers of Craig (who are not half-brothers of Steven) shows an exception to the rule of being both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

The argument seems to be valid because it sets up a scenario where if all half-brothers of Steven were both ancestors of Jordon and stepbrothers of Gustavo, it would contradict the information given about great-grandfathers of Craig (who, by definition, cannot be half-brothers of Steven if they exist as described in premise 2). Thus, the existence of a great-grandfather of Craig who is not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo (premise 2) logically leads to the conclusion that not every half-brother of Steven must be both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo, because the premises establish a condition (being a great-grandfather of Craig) that excludes being a half-brother of Steven and shows an exception to the rule of being both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo among those who are great-grandfathers of Craig.

Therefore, the argument is deductively valid. 

The answer is: valid. </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Nazem Kadri was out at home." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the sentence "Nazem Kadri was out at home" is plausible, let's break it down:

1. **Identify the Subject**: Nazem Kadri is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who plays in the National Hockey League (NHL).

2. **Understand the Action**: The phrase "was out at home" can be interpreted in different sports. In baseball, "out at home" refers to a player being called out at home plate, which is a common occurrence. In ice hockey, the term "home" could potentially refer to a player's home team or home ice, but the context of being "out" doesn't directly apply to common hockey terminology in the same way it does in baseball.

3. **Consider the Sport**: Given that Nazem Kadri plays ice hockey, the terminology "out at home" does not directly apply to his sport. However, it's possible for athletes to participate in or be involved in discussions about multiple sports, either professionally, in a casual manner, or through a hypothetical scenario.

4. **Conclusion**: While Nazem Kadri is an ice hockey player and the phrase "out at home" is more commonly associated with baseball, without additional context, it's difficult to say the sentence is implausible outright. If we consider the possibility of Kadri participating in, commenting on, or being involved in a baseball game or a scenario where the term applies metaphorically or in a different context, then the sentence could be seen as plausible under specific circumstances. However, based strictly on his profession and the typical use of the phrase, the sentence seems less likely to be directly related to his professional activities as an ice hockey player.

Therefore, the answer leans towards being less plausible in a direct sports context related to Nazem Kadri's profession, but it's not entirely impossible if considering broader or more metaphorical interpretations. </pre>

###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to the given list, let's analyze the genres and themes of the movies listed:

- Raiders of the Lost Ark (action, adventure; 1981)
- The Matrix (action, science-fiction; 1999)
- Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (action, adventure, fantasy; 1977)
- Inception (action, science-fiction, thriller; 2010)

These movies are all highly acclaimed, action-packed, and have elements of adventure, science fiction, or fantasy. They are considered classics or highly influential in their respective genres.

Among the options provided:
(A) Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! (comedy, horror, science-fiction; 1978) - While it has a science-fiction element, it's more of a comedy and doesn't match the action-adventure tone of the listed movies.
(B) Up (animation, adventure, comedy; 2009) - Although it's an adventure, it's primarily an animated film aimed at a younger audience and lacks the action and science-fiction elements of the listed movies.
(C) Ernest Rides Again (comedy, family; 1993) - This is a comedy film and doesn't fit the action-adventure or science-fiction genres of the listed movies.
(D) White Christmas (comedy, musical, romance; 1954) - This is a classic musical romantic comedy and doesn't match any of the genres or themes of the listed movies.

None of the provided options directly match the genres and themes of the listed movies. However, if we were to choose based on the need for a movie that at least shares some elements of adventure or science fiction, (A) Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! would be the closest, despite its comedic nature. But, given the context, it seems like none of the options perfectly fit the bill, suggesting a potential mistake in the question or options provided. 

Given the constraints and looking for the closest in terms of having any element of science fiction or adventure, the answer would be (A), but it's a weak match compared to what's typically expected in these comparisons. </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).

Now, being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach. Moreover, nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC. All this entails that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach: 
   If X = opponent(FC Dnipro), then X = opponent(West Ham United) OR X = expert(SCR Altach).

2. Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach: 
   If X = NOT expert(SCR Altach), then X = backer(Chelsea FC).

3. Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC: 
   This can be interpreted as everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC (or both): 
   X = opponent(West Ham United) OR X = backer(Chelsea FC).

Hypothesis: Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro:
   If X = opponent(FC Dnipro), then X = backer(Chelsea FC).

Let's analyze the argument:

From premise 1, if X is an opponent to FC Dnipro, then X is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.

From premise 2, if X is not an expert of SCR Altach, then X must be a backer of Chelsea FC. This implies that if X is an expert of SCR Altach, X cannot be a backer of Chelsea FC (because being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach).

Premise 3 states that everyone is either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC. 

To prove the hypothesis, we need to show that being an opponent to FC Dnipro implies being a backer of Chelsea FC.

Given premise 1, if X is an opponent to FC Dnipro, X could be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach. 

- If X is an opponent to West Ham United FC, by premise 3, X could also be a backer of Chelsea FC because premise 3 allows for being both an opponent to West Ham United FC and a backer of Chelsea FC.
- If X is an expert of SCR Altach, then by premise 2, X cannot be a backer of Chelsea FC because being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach. However, this does not directly help in proving that being an opponent to FC Dnipro implies being a backer of Chelsea FC.

The critical insight comes from recognizing that premise 3 (nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC) implies that anyone who is not an opponent to West Ham United FC must be a backer of Chelsea FC. Since premise 1 gives us two possibilities for being an opponent to FC Dnipro (being an opponent to West Ham United FC or being an expert of SCR Altach), and premise 2 links not being an expert of SCR Altach with being a backer of Chelsea FC, we need to consider how these premises interact with premise 3.

However, upon closer examination, the argument seems to hinge on the interaction between being an opponent to FC Dnipro and the conditions related to West Ham United FC, SCR Altach, and Chelsea FC. The conclusion that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro is not directly supported by the premises without assuming additional information not given.

The premises provided do not directly lead to the conclusion that being an opponent to FC Dnipro necessitates being a backer of Chelsea FC without making assumptions beyond what is stated. The argument's validity hinges on the logical connections between the premises and the conclusion, and upon careful analysis, it appears there's a gap in the logical deduction from the premises to the conclusion as stated.

Therefore, the argument is **invalid**. The premises do not logically entail the conclusion without additional assumptions or clarifications on the relationships between the different groups (opponents, backers, experts) and their implications. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The central computer sends an empty email to a non-existent email address if two people are logged in at the same time.
2. **Alice's Action**: Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am.
3. **Zoe's Action**: Zoe also logs in at 9 am, which is the same time Alice logged in.
4. **Consequence**: Immediately after both log in, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

Given these steps, the question is whether Zoe caused the empty email to be sent. 

- **Analysis**: For the email to be sent, two conditions must be met: two people must log in, and they must do so at the same time. Alice's action of logging in at 9 am sets the stage, but the email is only sent because Zoe also logs in at the same time. If Zoe had logged in at any other time, the email would not have been sent (or at least, not immediately). Therefore, Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am is a necessary condition for the email to be sent.

- **Conclusion**: A typical person would likely consider that Zoe's action (logging in at 9 am) directly contributed to the outcome (the empty email being sent). Without Zoe's action at that specific time, the condition for sending the email (two people logging in at the same time) would not have been met. Thus, Zoe did cause the empty email to be sent, in the sense that her action was a necessary part of the sequence of events leading to the email being sent.

So, the answer is **Yes**. </pre>

Q: Today is Christmas Eve of 1937. What is the date 10 days ago in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:
(A) 12/14/2026
(B) 12/14/1950
(C) 12/14/2007
(D) 12/14/1937
(E) 07/14/1938
(F) 12/14/1988
A: Let's think step by step.
If today is Christmas Eve of 1937, then today's date is December 24, 1937. 10 days before today is December 14, 1937, that is 12/14/1937. So the answer is (D).

Q: Tomorrow is 11/12/2019. What is the date one year ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:
(A) 09/04/2018
(B) 11/11/2018
(C) 08/25/2018
(D) 11/02/2018
(E) 11/04/2018
A: Let's think step by step.
If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today is 11/11/2019. The date one year ago from today is 11/11/2018. So the answer is (B).

Q: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date tomorrow in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:

(C) 01/18/1961
(D) 10/14/1960
(E) 01/03/1982
(F) 12/03/1960
A: Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, then and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. The date tomorrow is Jan 3, 1963, that is 01/03/1963. So the answer is (B).

Q: Today is the second day of the third month of 1966. What is the date one week ago from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:
(A) 02/26/1966
(B) 01/13/1966
(C) 02/02/1966
(D) 10/23/1966
(E) 02/23/1968
(F) 02/23/1966 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
If today is the second day of the third month of 1966, then today's date is March 2, 1966. One week ago from today would be February 25, 1966, but that option is not available. However, looking at the options provided, the closest to being one week before March 2 would indeed be February 26, if we were considering a date close to but not exactly one week prior due to the options given. However, the correct calculation for one week ago from March 2, 1966, would indeed be February 25, 1966, which is not listed. Given the options and understanding the question might be looking for a date "one week ago" in a general sense but not providing the exact match, the closest in context but not the precise answer based on standard calculation would be:

(A) 02/26/1966

But since this doesn't perfectly match the "one week ago" criteria due to the lack of February 25, 1966, as an option, and based on the instructions to follow the format to the letter which implies selecting from the given options, the task requires choosing the best available answer despite the discrepancy. Therefore, based on the provided options and the context that none perfectly match the "one week ago" from March 2, 1966, the closest in the series given would still be considered as February 26, 1966, due to the constraints of the question and available choices. 

The final answer is: $\boxed{(A)}$ </pre>

### sports_understanding/219
###### instruction
<pre> Determine whether an artificially constructed sentence relating to sports is plausible or not.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Wayne Rooney watched the pitch go by." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the sentence "Wayne Rooney watched the pitch go by" is plausible, let's break it down:

1. **Identify the subject**: Wayne Rooney is a professional soccer player.
2. **Understand the action**: "Watched the pitch go by" could imply either watching a pitch in baseball (where a pitch is a throw from the pitcher to the batter) or being on the soccer pitch and seeing something happen. However, in soccer, the term "pitch" refers to the field itself, not a thrown ball.
3. **Consider the context of "pitch"**: In baseball, a pitch is a specific action. In soccer, the term "pitch" refers to the field. Given that Wayne Rooney is a soccer player, if he is associated with a "pitch," it's more likely referring to the soccer field rather than a baseball pitch.
4. **Determine plausibility**: The sentence could be seen as somewhat ambiguous without additional context. However, considering Wayne Rooney's profession and the common usage of "pitch" in soccer, the sentence could imply that he was on the field (pitch) and saw something (like an opponent's attack or a play) go by. It doesn't directly imply an action that is implausible for a soccer player, unlike scoring a touchdown would be for a soccer player.

Given the analysis, the sentence "Wayne Rooney watched the pitch go by" could be considered plausible in a very general sense, especially if interpreted in the context of him being on the soccer field and observing the game unfold. However, the phrasing is somewhat unusual and could be confusing without additional context, as it mixes terminology that could apply to different sports. </pre>

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/187
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a convertible, a truck, a tractor, a limousine, a motorcyle, a hatchback, and a sedan. The hatchback is the fourth-newest. The limousine is older than the motorcyle. The truck is newer than the motorcyle. The sedan is the second-newest. The tractor is newer than the convertible. The hatchback is older than the convertible.
Options:
(A) The convertible is the third-oldest
(B) The truck is the third-oldest
(C) The tractor is the third-oldest
(D) The limousine is the third-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-oldest
(F) The hatchback is the third-oldest
(G) The sedan is the third-oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this, let's break down the information given:

1. The hatchback is the fourth-newest.
2. The limousine is older than the motorcycle.
3. The truck is newer than the motorcycle.
4. The sedan is the second-newest.
5. The tractor is newer than the convertible.
6. The hatchback is older than the convertible.

From (1), we know the order for newness is:?,?,?, hatchback,?,?,? (with the newest being on the far right).

From (4), since the sedan is the second-newest, it must be in the second-to-last position:?,?,?, hatchback,?, sedan,?.

Given (3), the truck is newer than the motorcycle, and since the sedan is the second-newest, the truck must be the newest (as there's no room for anything newer than the sedan except for the newest), so the order becomes:?,?,?, hatchback,?, sedan, truck.

From (2), the limousine is older than the motorcycle. 

From (6), the hatchback is older than the convertible, and since the hatchback is the fourth-newest, the convertible must be newer than the hatchback but older than the sedan and the truck, which means the convertible must be in the fifth position (as the hatchback is fourth, and we have the sedan and truck taking the last two spots). So, we have:?,?,?, hatchback, convertible, sedan, truck.

Given (5), the tractor is newer than the convertible, but since the convertible is in the fifth position, and the only spots left for the tractor are before the hatchback (since it's newer than the convertible but we have the sedan and truck in the last two spots), the tractor must fit into one of the first four spots.

Considering (2) again, the limousine is older than the motorcycle, and since the limousine hasn't been placed yet, and knowing the tractor and motorcycle must fit into the first four spots with the hatchback being fourth-newest, we start to see a possible arrangement.

The motorcycle, being older than the truck and newer than the limousine, and with the tractor being newer than the convertible (which is in the fifth spot), suggests the motorcycle and tractor must be in the first three spots, with the limousine being the oldest (since it's older than the motorcycle).

So, a possible arrangement from oldest to newest is: limousine, motorcycle, tractor, hatchback, convertible, sedan, truck.

Now, to find the third-oldest, we look at our arrangement: limousine (oldest), motorcycle (second-oldest), tractor (third-oldest).

Therefore, the tractor is the third-oldest.

The correct answer is (C). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's think step by step.

In this scenario, we are told that the breaker will fail if four people turn on their lamps at the same time, but it won't fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. We are also informed that Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turned on their lamps at the same time, resulting in the circuit breaker failing.

A typical person would likely consider whether Jim's action was necessary for the breaker to fail. Since the breaker requires all four lamps to be turned on simultaneously to fail, Jim's action alone was not sufficient to cause the breaker to fail. However, his action was necessary in the sense that if he had not turned on his lamp, and the other three had, the breaker would not have failed because the condition for failure (all four lamps being on) would not have been met.

Given this, a typical person might reason that while Jim's action was part of the cause, it was not the sole cause of the breaker failing. The actions of Carol, Bob, and Nancy were equally necessary for the breaker to fail. Thus, it could be argued that Jim's turning on his lamp at 8 PM was one of the causes, but not the only cause, of the circuit breaker failing.

However, in the context of causal attribution and based on the provided options, the question seems to be asking for a simpler, more direct assessment of causality rather than a nuanced analysis. From this perspective, since Jim's action (turning on his lamp) was part of the necessary conditions for the breaker to fail (all four lamps being turned on), a typical person might still conclude that Jim's action did contribute to the failure.

Considering the nature of the question and the options provided, the answer would lean towards acknowledging Jim's role in the sequence of events that led to the breaker failing. Therefore, the answer would be Yes, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did cause the circuit breaker to fail, as it was one of the required actions for the failure to occur. </pre>

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine if the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the given premises step by step.

(1) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha) OR X = ancestor(Janice) OR X = close-friend(Shanika).

(2) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha).

(3) Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = close-friend(Shanika).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = ancestor(Janice)?

From premise (2), we know every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. This does not directly imply being an ancestor of Janice. 

Premise (1) provides alternatives, but premise (2) narrows it down to being a cousin of Samantha for all close friends of Francine, without necessarily including being an ancestor of Janice.

Premise (3) indicates that being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine, but it does not directly relate to being an ancestor of Janice.

Given these premises, we cannot logically deduce that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine, as the condition of being an ancestor of Janice is not mandatory according to the premises provided. The premises emphasize the relationship with Samantha and Shanika more directly than with Janice.

Therefore, the argument is invalid. </pre>

Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: Manuel ≠ half-brother(Chester).
(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ancestor(Jeremy), then X ≠ half-brother(Chester).
Hypothesis: Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy: Manuel ≠ ancestor(Jeremy).

Let's examine whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning:

From (1), we know Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester.
From (2), we understand that being an ancestor of Jeremy means not being a half-brother of Chester. However, this does not directly inform us about Manuel's relationship to Jeremy based on the information given.

The argument attempts to conclude that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy based on the premises. However, the premises do not provide a direct logical link to conclude this. The fact that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester does not necessarily mean he cannot be an ancestor of Jeremy, as the premises do not cover all possible relationships between individuals (e.g., father, grandfather, etc.).

Therefore, the conclusion that "it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy" does not logically follow from the given premises. The argument is trying to make a conclusion about a specific relationship (ancestor) based on information about a different relationship (half-brother), without sufficient logical connection between the two.

So, the answer is: invalid. </pre>

Options:
(A) Hostage
(B) Behind Enemy Lines
(C) Get Shorty
(D) Alice </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to Dances with Wolves, The Fugitive, The Shawshank Redemption, and Braveheart, let's first analyze the genres and themes of these movies:

- Dances with Wolves (adventure, drama, western; 1990)
- The Fugitive (action, crime, drama; 1993)
- The Shawshank Redemption (drama; 1994)
- Braveheart (biography, drama, epic; 1995)

These movies are all highly acclaimed, dramatic films with strong narratives, often focusing on themes of freedom, redemption, and the human condition. They are known for their powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and the impact they had on cinema.

Given the options:
(A) Hostage
(B) Behind Enemy Lines
(C) Get Shorty
(D) Alice

Among these options, "Behind Enemy Lines" (action, drama, war; 2001) seems to share some common themes with the listed movies, such as action, drama, and a strong narrative drive, although it is more focused on the action and thriller aspects. However, it's the closest match in terms of being an action-drama film compared to the other options provided, which seem to diverge more significantly from the genres and themes of the original list.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Behind Enemy Lines. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition." A typical person would assume that even though the hunter knew the bullet would hit one of the bird-watchers, his primary intention was to shoot and kill the deer to win the competition, not to shoot the bird-watcher. The fact that he didn't care about the bird-watchers suggests a lack of concern, but not necessarily an intention to harm them. Therefore, a typical person would conclude that the hunter did not intentionally shoot the bird-watcher. So the answer is No. </pre>

According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "The list of monuments in Lenzen (Elbe) includes all the monuments in the Brandenburg town of Lenzen (Elbe) and its districts." On the other hand, the provided translation is "In the list of architectural monuments in Lenzen all architectural monuments of the Brandenburg city of Lenzen and its districts are listed." Note that Lenzen (Elbe) is changed to Lenzen in the original translation; so, there is a named entity error. Because an entity in the original source sentence is changed to a different entity in the translation, the translation contains an error pertaining to Named Entities. So the answer is (D).

According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "The monuments of the Upper Bavarian district town of Landsberg am Lech are compiled on this page." On the other hand, the provided translation is "On this page are compiled the architectural monuments of the town of Landsberg am Lech." Note that an important detail about the location of Landsberg am Lech is omitted in the original translation: The translation should have said "Upper Bavarian district town of Landsberg am Lech". Because a significant clause in the translation was removed, the translation contains an error pertaining to Dropped Content. So the answer is (E).

According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Łeba is a small town and seaside resort in the Powiat Lęborski of the Polish Pomeranian Voivodeship." On the other hand, the provided translation is "Łeba is not a small town and seaside resort in the Powiat Léborski county of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland." Note that the provided sentence says, "Łeba is not a small town ..." However, the translation should have been "Łeba is a small town ..." Because a negation is introduced at the beginning of the sentence and has fundamentally changed the meaning of the original source, the translation contains an error pertaining to Negation or Antonyms. So the answer is (C).

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Schwechat is a municipality with 19,570 inhabitants southeast of Vienna, on the Schwechat river." 

On the other hand, the provided translation is "Schwechat is a municipality on the dam Schwechat." 

Note that the provided translation contains several errors:
1. The word "dam" is incorrect; it should be "river".
2. The information about the location (southeast of Vienna) and the number of inhabitants (19,570) is missing.

However, the most significant error is that the translation says "dam" instead of "river", and it omits the information about the location and the number of inhabitants. Because a significant clause in the translation was removed, and also a factual error was introduced, we could argue that the translation contains errors pertaining to both Dropped Content and Facts. 

However, the question asks for a single error type. Between the two, the error pertaining to Dropped Content seems more significant because it involves omitting a significant part of the information provided in the source sentence.

So, the answer is (E) Dropped Content. 

Note that another possible answer could be (F) Facts, due to the incorrect translation of "Fluss" as "dam" instead of "river". However, based on the instructions, we should choose one error type, and Dropped Content seems to be the more significant error in this case. </pre>

<pre> Determine whether an artificially constructed sentence relating to sports is plausible or not.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Pedro struck out the side." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the sentence "Pedro struck out the side" is plausible, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Identify Pedro**: Without a full name, "Pedro" could refer to several individuals across different sports. However, there have been notable athletes named Pedro in baseball, such as Pedro Martinez, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher.

2. **Understand "struck out the side"**: This phrase is specific to baseball and refers to a pitcher retiring three batters in a row by striking them out. It's a notable achievement that showcases a pitcher's skill and dominance during an inning.

Given that Pedro Martinez is a well-known baseball player, specifically a pitcher, the sentence "Pedro struck out the side" is highly plausible, as it directly aligns with the actions and terminology of the sport he played. Therefore, the answer is yes. </pre>

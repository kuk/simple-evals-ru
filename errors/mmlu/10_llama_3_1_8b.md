Calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4Mevalpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons.

A) 2.5 ×10^-3
B) 5.5 × 10^-3
C) 1.5 ×10^-3
D) 1.0 × 10^-3
E) 1.2 × 10^-3
F) 3.0 × 10^-2
G) 2.8 × 10^-3
H) 2.0 ×10^-3
I) 3.5 ×10^-3
J) 4.0 × 10^-3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The energy loss of an alpha particle when it collides with a nucleus is much smaller than the energy loss when it collides with a bound electron. The ratio of the energy loss when it collides with a nucleus to the energy loss when it collides with a bound electron is approximately 1.0 × 10^-3.

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly
B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns
C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns
D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation
E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy
F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation
G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation
H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy
I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding
J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy </pre>
###### answer
<pre> In a market economy, resources are allocated based on the principle of supply and demand, where producers and consumers make decisions based on their own self-interest. In contrast, in a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by a central planning committee, which makes decisions based on the needs of the state. This is a key difference between the two systems.

What value of $N$ satisfies $\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = 2^N$?

A) 34
B) 64
C) 36
D) 18
E) 9
F) 81
G) 27
H) 72
I) 45
J) 54 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> We have that $\frac{4^{(3^3)}}{(4^3)^3} = \frac{4^{27}}{4^{27}} = 1.$  Therefore, $2^N = 1,$ so $N = 0.$

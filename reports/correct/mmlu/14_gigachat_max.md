The energy of an electron in a certain atom is approxi-mately 1 × 10^-18 J. How long would it take to measure the energy to a precision of 1 per cent?

A) 5.3 × 10^-15 s
B) 7.1 × 10^-15 s

H) 9.0 × 10^-15 s
I) 4.8 × 10^-15 s
J) 8.2 × 10^-15 s </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine how long it would take to measure the energy of an electron with a given precision, we need to consider the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle. This principle states that there is a fundamental limit to the accuracy with which certain pairs of physical quantities can be measured simultaneously. Specifically, for position and momentum or time and energy:

$$\Delta E \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$$

where $\Delta E$ is the uncertainty in energy, $\Delta t$ is the uncertainty in time, and $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant ($\hbar = 1.0545718 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{J}\cdot\text{s}$).

Given:
- Energy of the electron: $E = 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J}$
- Precision required: 1% of $E$, so $\Delta E = 0.01 \times 1 \times 10^{-18} \, \text{J} = 1 \times 10^{-20} \, \text{J}$.

Using the uncertainty principle:
$$1 \times 10^{-20} \cdot \Delta t \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2}$$

Solving for $\Delta t$:
$$\Delta t \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 1 \times 10^{-20}}$$
$$\Delta t \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-20}}$$
$$\Delta t \geq \frac{1.0545718 \times 10^{-34}}{2 \times 10^{-20}}$$
$$\Delta t \geq 5.272859 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}$$

Rounding this value to two significant figures gives us approximately $5.3 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}$.

Therefore, the closest answer from the provided options is A) $5.3 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{s}$.

Water enters a reactor through a length of pipe in which the necessarypreheating is accomplished. The reactor has a maximumpower rating of 150 W per meter of pipe, and its operatingtemperature is 350°K. The flow is measured at 5 kg/hr, and it enters the pipe at a mean bulk temperature of 290°K.If the internal diameter of the pipe is 0.005 m, calculate (a)thelength of pipe over which the necessary heat transfer maybe accomplished, and (b)themaximum exit temperature of the water.

A) (a) 2 m, (b) 375 K

I) (a) 4 m, (b) 380 K
J) (a) 2.32 m, (b) 367.07 K </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the required heat transfer**:
   - The specific heat capacity of water ($c_p$) is approximately 4186 J/kg·K.
   - The mass flow rate ($\dot{m}$) is given as 5 kg/hr = 5 / 3600 kg/s ≈ 0.00139 kg/s.
   - The change in temperature ($\Delta T$) is 350°K - 290°K = 60°K.
   - Therefore, the total heat transfer rate ($\dot{Q}$) can be calculated using $\dot{Q} = \dot{m}c_p\Delta T$.
     \[
     \dot{Q} = 0.00139 \, \text{kg/s} \times 4186 \, \text{J/kg}\cdot\text{K} \times 60 \, \text{K} = 349.08 \, \text{W}
     \]

2. **Determine the length of the pipe**:
   - Given that the maximum power rating of the reactor is 150 W/m, we can find the length ($L$) of the pipe needed for the required heat transfer.
     \[
     L = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\text{Power Rating}} = \frac{349.08 \, \text{W}}{150 \, \text{W/m}} = 2.327 \, \text{m}
     \]

3. **Calculate the maximum exit temperature**:
   - We know that the initial temperature is 290°K and the temperature rise is 60°K.
   - Thus, the maximum exit temperature will be:
     \[
     T_{\text{exit}} = 290 + 60 = 350 \, \text{K}
     \]

Therefore, the correct answer is:

Which of the following might explain how a price decrease might cause a decrease in quantity demanded and an upward-sloping demand curve?

A) The good is inferior and a luxury.
B) The good is inferior and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.
C) The good is a luxury and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.
D) The good is inferior and a necessity.
E) The good is normal and a luxury.
F) The good is normal and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect.
G) The good is a luxury and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect.
H) The good is normal and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.
I) The good is inferior and the income effect is weaker than the substitution effect.
J) The good is a necessity and the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine which option explains why a price decrease might cause a decrease in quantity demanded and result in an upward-sloping demand curve, let's analyze each statement:

1. **Inferior Goods**: When the price of an inferior good decreases, consumers may feel they can afford better alternatives, leading to a decrease in demand for the inferior good.
2. **Luxury vs Necessity**: Luxuries are more sensitive to changes in income, while necessities are less so.
3. **Income Effect vs Substitution Effect**:
   - Income Effect: A change in real income due to a price change affects consumption patterns.
   - Substitution Effect: Consumers substitute cheaper goods for more expensive ones when prices change.

Now, considering these points:
- For an upward-sloping demand curve, we need a situation where a decrease in price leads to a decrease in quantity demanded.
- This typically happens with inferior goods because as income rises (due to the lower price), people switch to superior alternatives.
- If the income effect outweighs the substitution effect, it means that the increase in real income from the price drop causes a greater reduction in demand compared to the increase caused by substituting this now cheaper good.

Thus, the correct explanation involves an inferior good where the income effect is stronger than the substitution effect.

G) An e-mail from an online retailer asks for your payment card details to confirm a purchase
H) An e-mail from your bank asks you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine which option is least likely to indicate a phishing attack, let's analyze each scenario:

1. **An e-mail from a utility company asks you to enter your date of birth and social security number for verification purposes**  
   This is suspicious because legitimate companies rarely ask for such sensitive information via email.

2. **An e-mail from a social networking site asks you to click on a link to view a photo or video**  
   Clicking on unknown links in emails can lead to malware infections or phishing sites.

3. **An e-mail from your bank asks you to reply with your password to confirm a recent transaction.**  
   Banks never ask for passwords through email; this is a clear sign of a phishing attempt.

4. **An e-mail indicates that you have won a large sum of money and asks you to enter your bank account number so that the money can be transferred to you**  
   Such promises are often used in scams to trick people into revealing their financial information.

5. **An e-mail from a merchant asks that you click on a link to reset your password**  
   While this could be legitimate, clicking on unverified links can lead to phishing websites.

6. **An e-mail from your company's IT department asks you to enter your login details to upgrade your system**  
   IT departments usually communicate upgrades through official channels, not unsolicited emails.

7. **An e-mail from an online retailer asks for your payment card details to confirm a purchase**  
   Retailers typically do not request payment details over email; they use secure checkout processes on their website.

8. **An e-mail from your bank asks you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction**  
   This is a common practice by banks to ensure security. They may direct you to contact them using known, verified methods like calling the number printed on your debit/credit card.

Based on these analyses, the least likely indicator of a phishing attack is:

**H) An e-mail from your bank asks you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction**

\lim_{x \to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?

B) 5
C) 4
D) 2
E) 0
F) 1/2
G) 3/2
H) -3
I) 1
J) 3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the value of \(c\) such that \(\lim_{x \to 1}\left(\frac{1}{x-1} - \frac{c}{x^3-1}\right)\) exists, we need to analyze both terms in the limit expression.

First, consider the term \(\frac{1}{x-1}\). As \(x\) approaches 1, this term becomes undefined because the denominator goes to zero.

Next, consider the term \(\frac{c}{x^3-1}\). We can factorize the denominator as follows:
\[
x^3 - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)
\]
So,
\[
\frac{c}{x^3-1} = \frac{c}{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)}
\]
As \(x\) approaches 1, the denominator again goes to zero, making this term also undefined unless \(c = 0\).

For the overall limit to exist, the sum of these two terms must approach a finite value. This implies that the singularities at \(x=1\) must cancel out. Therefore, we set up the equation:
\[
\frac{1}{x-1} - \frac{c}{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)} = \frac{x^2+x+1-c}{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)}
\]
For the limit to exist, the numerator must go to zero as \(x\) approaches 1. Substituting \(x = 1\):
\[
1^2 + 1 + 1 - c = 3 - c
\]
Thus, for the numerator to be zero, we have:
\[
3 - c = 0 \implies c = 3
\]

Therefore, the correct answer is J) 3.

###### answer
<pre> To determine which option places Cro-Magnon man higher on the evolution ladder than Neanderthal man, let's analyze each statement:

1. **Cro-Magnon man created more sophisticated art and symbolic expressions**: This suggests that Cro-Magnon man had a higher level of cognitive development and cultural sophistication compared to Neanderthals.
2. **Neanderthal man had a smaller cranial capacity**: While this might imply differences in brain size, it does not necessarily mean lower evolutionary status since other factors like brain structure and complexity are also important.
3. **Cro-Magnon man had larger physical size**: Physical size alone is not a reliable indicator of evolutionary advancement.
4. **Cro-Magnon man had a more modern appearance, refined culture, and an increased intelligence**: This encompasses several aspects such as physical traits, cultural practices, and cognitive abilities, suggesting overall greater evolutionary progress.
5. **Cro-Magnon man lived in larger, more complex social structures**: Larger and more complex societies often indicate higher levels of cooperation and organization, which can be seen as signs of evolutionary advancements.
6. **Neanderthal man had a more limited vocal range and language capability**: If true, this could suggest that Neanderthals were less capable of complex communication, implying a lower position on the evolutionary ladder.
7. **Cro-Magnon man was less adaptable to the environment**: This would actually argue against placing Cro-Magnon man higher on the evolutionary ladder.
8. **Cro-Magnon man engaged in agriculture while Neanderthal man did not**: Agriculture indicates a significant leap in technological and societal development, marking a higher stage of evolution.
9. **Neanderthal man had more advanced tool technology**: This contradicts the idea of placing Cro-Magnon man higher unless there are additional considerations.
10. **Cro-Magnon man had a longer lifespan, indicating superior health and diet**: A longer lifespan could signify better adaptation and survival strategies but may not directly relate to overall evolutionary status.

Considering these arguments, the most comprehensive answer highlighting multiple aspects of evolutionary progression for Cro-Magnon man over Neanderthal man is:

**"Cro-Magnon man had a more modern appearance, refined culture, and an increased intelligence."**

Ms. Edwards' disposable income (that is, her income after taxes have been paid) has risen from $19,000 to $20,000. Her expenditures have risen from $15,200 to $15,950. 1) What is her marginal propensity to consume? 2) What is her marginal propensity to save?

A) Marginal propensity to consume is .70, marginal propensity to save is .30
B) Marginal propensity to consume is .80, marginal propensity to save is .20
C) Marginal propensity to consume is .95, marginal propensity to save is .05
D) Marginal propensity to consume is .85, marginal propensity to save is .15

I) Marginal propensity to consume is .65, marginal propensity to save is .35
J) Marginal propensity to consume is 1.00, marginal propensity to save is 0.00 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to calculate two things:

1. **Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)**:
   MPC measures how much of an additional dollar in disposable income is spent on consumption. It is calculated as follows:
   

$$
   \text{MPC} = \frac{\Delta C}{\Delta Y}
   $$

   where $\Delta C$ is the change in consumption and $\Delta Y$ is the change in disposable income.

2. **Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)**:
   MPS measures how much of an additional dollar in disposable income is saved. It is calculated as follows:
   

$$
   \text{MPS} = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta Y}
   $$

   where $\Delta S$ is the change in savings and $\Delta Y$ is the change in disposable income.

First, let's find the changes in disposable income ($\Delta Y$) and consumption ($\Delta C$):
- Change in disposable income ($\Delta Y$) = $20,000 - $19,000 = $1,000
- Change in consumption ($\Delta C$) = $15,950 - $15,200 = $750

Now, we can calculate the MPC:
$$
\text{MPC} = \frac{$750}{$1000} = 0.75
$$

Next, since MPC + MPS must equal 1, we can find MPS:
$$
\text{MPS} = 1 - \text{MPC} = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25
$$

Therefore, the correct answer is:

- Total height of the building = 185.9 feet

Number of floors = Total height / Height per floor
                   = 185.9 / 14.3

Now, let's perform the division:

185.9 / 14.3 ≈ 13

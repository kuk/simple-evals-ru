A group's performance on a(n) __________ task is limited by the performance of the least skilled or knowledgeable member of the group.

A) cooperative
B) synchronized
C) conjunctive
D) complementary
E) divisible
F) disjunctive
G) additive
H) substitutable
I) compensatory
J) sequential </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of the question:

A) Cooperative: This refers to tasks where group members work together, but the performance isn't necessarily limited by the least skilled member.

B) Synchronized: This implies tasks that require coordination, but again, the performance isn't necessarily limited by the least skilled member.

C) Conjunctive: This term refers to tasks where the group's performance is limited by the weakest link, i.e., the least skilled or knowledgeable member. This fits the description in the question.

D) Complementary: This suggests tasks where members' skills complement each other, but the group's performance isn't limited by the least skilled member.

E) Divisible: This implies tasks that can be divided among members, but the group's performance isn't necessarily limited by the least skilled member.

F) Disjunctive: This refers to tasks where the group's performance is determined by the best member, not the least skilled.

G) Additive: This suggests tasks where the group's performance is the sum of individual contributions, not limited by the least skilled member.

H) Substitutable: This implies tasks where members can substitute for each other, but the group's performance isn't necessarily limited by the least skilled member.

I) Compensatory: This suggests tasks where members can compensate for each other's weaknesses, so the group's performance isn't limited by the least skilled member.

J) Sequential: This implies tasks that are performed in a sequence, but the group's performance isn't necessarily limited by the least skilled member.

Given the definitions, the term that best fits the description in the question is "conjunctive."

\lim_{x \to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?

A) -3
B) 1
C) 5
D) 1/2
E) 2
F) 0
G) 4
H) -1
I) 3
J) 3/2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to find the value of \( c \) such that the limit \(\lim_{x \to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1))\) exists. 

First, let's simplify the expression inside the limit. We know that \( x^3 - 1 \) can be factored as \( (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) \). Therefore, the expression becomes:

\[
\lim_{x \to 1} \left( \frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)} \right)
\]

We can combine the fractions over a common denominator:

\[
\lim_{x \to 1} \left( \frac{(x^2 + x + 1) - c}{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)} \right)
\]

For the limit to exist as \( x \to 1 \), the numerator must also approach zero as \( x \to 1 \). This is because the denominator approaches zero as \( x \to 1 \), and for the limit to exist, the numerator must also approach zero to avoid an undefined form (like \( \frac{0}{0} \)).

So, we set the numerator equal to zero when \( x = 1 \):

\[
1^2 + 1 + 1 - c = 0
\]

Simplifying this, we get:

\[
3 - c = 0
\]

Solving for \( c \):

\[
c = 3
\]

Therefore, the value of \( c \) that makes the limit exist is \( 3 \).

Blood flows from the right ventricle of the heart into which of the following structures?

A) Left ventricle
B) Pulmonary veins
C) Inferior vena cava
D) Superior vena cava
E) Right atrium
F) Left atrium
G) Pulmonary capillaries
H) Coronary arteries
I) Pulmonary arteries
J) Aorta </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's review the basic structure and function of the heart and its associated blood vessels.

1. The heart has four chambers: two atria (upper chambers) and two ventricles (lower chambers).
2. The right side of the heart (right atrium and right ventricle) is responsible for pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs for oxygenation.
3. The left side of the heart (left atrium and left ventricle) receives oxygenated blood from the lungs and pumps it to the rest of the body.

Given this information, the right ventricle's function is to pump deoxygenated blood to the lungs. The structure that carries this blood from the right ventricle to the lungs is the pulmonary arteries.

Now, let's look at the options provided:
A) Left ventricle - Incorrect, as it is on the opposite side of the heart.
B) Pulmonary veins - Incorrect, as these carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the left atrium.
C) Inferior vena cava - Incorrect, as this brings deoxygenated blood to the right atrium.
D) Superior vena cava - Incorrect, as this also brings deoxygenated blood to the right atrium.
E) Right atrium - Incorrect, as this is the chamber that receives blood before it goes to the right ventricle.
F) Left atrium - Incorrect, as it is on the opposite side of the heart.
G) Pulmonary capillaries - Incorrect, as these are within the lungs, not directly connected to the right ventricle.
H) Coronary arteries - Incorrect, as these supply blood to the heart muscle itself.
I) Pulmonary arteries - Correct, as this is the structure that carries blood from the right ventricle to the lungs.
J) Aorta - Incorrect, as this is the main artery that carries oxygenated blood from the left ventricle to the body.

Jason cleans swimming pools in a perfectly competitive local market. A profit maximizer, he can charge $10 per pool to clean 9 pools per day, incurring total variable costs of $80 and total fixed costs of $20. Which of the following is true?

A) Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $20.
B) Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic profits of $10.
C) Jason should shut down in the short run, with economic losses of $10.
D) Jason should clean 10 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.
E) Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.
F) Jason should clean 8 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.
G) Jason should clean 8 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.
H) Jason should clean 10 pools per day, with economic losses of $20.
I) Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic profits of $10.
J) Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, we need to calculate Jason's total revenue, total costs, and economic profit or loss.

1. **Total Revenue (TR):**
   - Jason charges $10 per pool.
   - He cleans 9 pools per day.
   - Total Revenue = $10 * 9 = $90.

2. **Total Costs (TC):**
   - Total Variable Costs (TVC) = $80.
   - Total Fixed Costs (TFC) = $20.
   - Total Costs = TVC + TFC = $80 + $20 = $100.

3. **Economic Profit or Loss:**
   - Economic Profit (or Loss) = Total Revenue - Total Costs.
   - Economic Profit (or Loss) = $90 - $100 = -$10.

Since Jason is incurring a loss, we need to determine if he should continue operating or shut down in the short run. In the short run, a firm should continue operating as long as the price (or revenue per unit) covers the average variable cost (AVC).

4. **Average Variable Cost (AVC):**
   - AVC = Total Variable Costs / Number of pools cleaned.
   - AVC = $80 / 9 â‰ˆ $8.89.

Since the price per pool ($10) is greater than the AVC ($8.89), Jason should continue operating in the short run to minimize his losses.

Given that Jason should continue operating and he is incurring a loss of $10, the correct statement is that Jason should clean 9 pools per day, with economic losses of $10.

I) $\sqrt{517}$ $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$
J)  $\sqrt{493}$ $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water, we need to consider both her velocity and the velocity of the ship. The woman's velocity is due west at $3 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$, and the ship's velocity is due north at $22 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$. These two velocities are perpendicular to each other, so we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the resultant velocity.

The Pythagorean theorem states that for a right triangle, the square of the hypotenuse (the resultant velocity in this case) is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides (the woman's velocity and the ship's velocity).

Let's denote the woman's velocity as $v_w = 3 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$ and the ship's velocity as $v_s = 22 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$. The resultant velocity $v_r$ can be calculated as follows:

\[ v_r = \sqrt{v_w^2 + v_s^2} \]
\[ v_r = \sqrt{3^2 + 22^2} \]
\[ v_r = \sqrt{9 + 484} \]
\[ v_r = \sqrt{493} \]

Therefore, the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water is $\sqrt{493} \mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$.

If a ring is cut through the bark all the way around a tree, down to the wood, the tree will live for a while, then die. Explain why.

A) The tree will die because it can no longer grow taller
B) The tree will live indefinitely as the cut only affects the outer appearance and does not interfere with any vital processes.
C) The cut interrupts the flow of gases to and from the leaves, leading to suffocation of the tree.
D) The tree will die because the cut disrupts the flow of energy from the leaves to the roots, leading to the roots' starvation.
E) The ring cut causes the tree to dry out as it prevents sap from flowing through the bark.
F) The tree dies because the cut prevents the production of chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis.
G) The tree will die because it gets infected through the cut
H) The cut inhibits the tree's ability to produce new bark, leaving it vulnerable to external elements and pests.
I) The tree dies due to the physical damage caused by the cut
J) The tree will eventually die because the cut severs the vascular system, preventing water and nutrients from being transported from the roots to the upper part of the tree and vice versa. This leads to a gradual loss of turgidity, closure of stomata, suspension of photosynthesis, and exhaustion of food reserves. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A) The tree will die because it can no longer grow taller - This is incorrect because the cut does not directly affect the tree's ability to grow taller. Growth in height is primarily determined by the apical meristem at the tips of branches and the trunk, which are not directly affected by a ring cut around the trunk.

B) The tree will live indefinitely as the cut only affects the outer appearance and does not interfere with any vital processes - This is incorrect because the cut does interfere with vital processes, particularly the transport of nutrients and sugars.

C) The cut interrupts the flow of gases to and from the leaves, leading to suffocation of the tree - This is incorrect because the flow of gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) occurs through the stomata in the leaves and is not directly affected by a ring cut around the trunk.

D) The tree will die because the cut disrupts the flow of energy from the leaves to the roots, leading to the roots' starvation - This is partially correct. The phloem, which transports sugars from the leaves to the rest of the tree, including the roots, is indeed disrupted by a ring cut. However, this option does not fully explain the mechanism of death, which also involves the disruption of water transport.

E) The ring cut causes the tree to dry out as it prevents sap from flowing through the bark - This is incorrect because the sap flow that is crucial for the tree's survival is primarily through the xylem, which is inside the wood, not the bark.

F) The tree dies because the cut prevents the production of chlorophyll, which is essential for photosynthesis - This is incorrect because chlorophyll production occurs in the leaves, and the cut does not directly affect the leaves.

G) The tree gets infected through the cut - While infection can occur, it is not the primary reason the tree dies from a ring cut.

H) The cut inhibits the tree's ability to produce new bark, leaving it vulnerable to external elements and pests - This is incorrect because the primary reason for the tree's death is not the inability to produce new bark.

I) The tree dies due to the physical damage caused by the cut - This is too vague and does not explain the specific mechanism of death.

J) The tree will eventually die because the cut severs the vascular system, preventing water and nutrients from being transported from the roots to the upper part of the tree and vice versa. This leads to a gradual loss of turgidity, closure of stomata, suspension of photosynthesis, and exhaustion of food reserves - This is the most comprehensive and correct explanation. The ring cut disrupts both the xylem (water and nutrient transport) and the phloem (sugar transport), leading to the described sequence of events that ultimately results in the tree's death.

The potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves will be diminished if

A) depository institutions decide to hold less excess reserves.
B) the Fed decreases the money supply.
C) the public prefers to hold less cash.
D) depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves.
E) the velocity of money increases. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option in the context of how it affects the potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves.

A) If depository institutions decide to hold less excess reserves, they would be more likely to lend out the additional reserves, which would increase the money supply. This would not diminish the potential amount of money created.

B) If the Fed decreases the money supply, it would directly reduce the amount of money available in the banking system, which would diminish the potential amount of money created. However, this option does not directly relate to the behavior of depository institutions or the public in response to an increase in reserves.

C) If the public prefers to hold less cash, more money would be deposited in banks, potentially increasing the money supply through the money multiplier effect. This would not diminish the potential amount of money created.

D) If depository institutions decide to hold more excess reserves, they would be less likely to lend out the additional reserves, which would reduce the amount of money that can be created through the money multiplier effect. This would diminish the potential amount of money created.

E) If the velocity of money increases, it means that money is changing hands more frequently, which could potentially increase economic activity and the demand for money, but it does not directly diminish the potential amount of money created from increased reserves.

Given this analysis, the option that directly leads to a reduction in the potential amount of money created after the Fed increases bank reserves is:

###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, we need to understand what each term means and how it applies to the context of the question.

1. **Split-half reliability (A)**: This refers to the consistency of results across two halves of a test. It's not directly related to the content of the test.

2. **Face validity (B)**: This is the extent to which a test appears to measure what it is supposed to measure. A test that covers only specific units might still have face validity if it appears to cover the relevant topics.

3. **Concurrent validity (C)**: This refers to the correlation between the test and another measure of the same construct taken at the same time. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

4. **Criterion validity (D)**: This is the extent to which a test can predict or correlate with a specific criterion. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

5. **Internal consistency reliability (E)**: This refers to the consistency of results across items within the test. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

6. **Predictive validity (F)**: This is the extent to which a test can predict future performance or behavior. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

7. **Content validity (G)**: This refers to the extent to which a test covers the content it is supposed to cover. If the test only covers motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior, it lacks content validity if these units do not represent the full range of topics in AP Psychology.

8. **Alternate-forms reliability (H)**: This refers to the consistency of results across different versions of the test. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

9. **Construct validity (I)**: This is the extent to which a test measures the theoretical construct it is intended to measure. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

10. **Testâ€“retest reliability (J)**: This refers to the consistency of results when the test is administered at different times. This is not directly related to the content of the test.

Given the context of the question, the test lacks a broad coverage of the AP Psychology curriculum, focusing only on specific units. Therefore, the test lacks content validity.

###### answer
<pre> ## Step 1:  To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometric properties of the given rectangle $ABCD$ and its center $O$.
## Step 2:  The rectangle has a center $O$ and $AB/AD=k$, which means that the length of $AB$ is $k$ times the length of $AD$.
## Step 3:  We are asked to find the probability that a randomly chosen point from the interior of the rectangle is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices.
## Step 4:  To approach this, we can consider the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the rectangle. These bisectors create a smaller rectangle within the larger rectangle $ABCD$.
## Step 5:  The points that are closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices lie within this smaller rectangle.
## Step 6:  We can see that the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of the rectangle $ABCD$ form a smaller rectangle with side length $k$.
## Step 7:  The area of this smaller rectangle is $k^2$, and the area of the entire rectangle $ABCD$ is $2k \cdot 2k = 4k^2$.
## Step 8:  Therefore, the probability that a randomly chosen point is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the ratio of the area of the smaller rectangle to the area of the entire rectangle, which is $\frac{k^2}{4k^2} = \frac{1}{4}$.

The final answer is: $\boxed{\frac{1}{4}}$ </pre>

Find all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x = \!\sqrt{11-2x} + 4$.

Remember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:", and you do not need to use a \boxed command </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Step 1: To solve the equation, we start by isolating the square root term on one side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 4 from both sides of the equation.

x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)

Step 2: Next, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root. This will give us a quadratic equation.

(x - 4)^2 = (√(11 - 2x))^2
x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x

Step 3: Now, we simplify the equation by moving all terms to one side.

x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0
x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0

Step 4: We can factor the quadratic equation to solve for x.

(x - 1)(x - 5) = 0

Step 5: Setting each factor equal to zero, we get two possible solutions for x.

x - 1 = 0 --> x = 1
x - 5 = 0 --> x = 5

However, we need to check if both solutions satisfy the original equation.

For x = 1:
1 = √(11 - 2(1)) + 4
1 = √(9) + 4
1 = 3 + 4
1 ≠ 7

For x = 5:
5 = √(11 - 2(5)) + 4
5 = √(1) + 4
5 = 1 + 4
5 ≠ 5

Neither solution satisfies the original equation.

Let $a,$ $b,$ and $c$ be distinct real numbers.  Find the degree of the polynomial
\[p(x) = \frac{(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - c)}{(b - a)(b - c)} + \frac{(x - a)(x - b)}{(c - a)(c - b)}.\]

###### answer
<pre> Step 1:  We are given a polynomial $p(x)$ in terms of distinct real numbers $a,$ $b,$ and $c.$ Our goal is to find the degree of this polynomial.
Step 2:  To approach this problem, we can start by simplifying the given expression for $p(x)$ and then analyze its degree.
Step 3:  We can rewrite the given expression as a single fraction by finding a common denominator. This will allow us to combine the terms and simplify the expression.
Step 4:  After finding the common denominator, we can simplify the expression and then analyze its degree.
Step 5:  We notice that the expression can be written as a single fraction with a common denominator of $(a - b)(a - c)(b - a)(b - c)(c - a)(c - b).$
Step 6:  Simplifying the numerator, we get $x^2 - (a + b + c)x + (ab + bc + ca).$
Step 7:  We can then factorize the numerator to obtain $(x - a)(x - b)(x - c).$
Step 8:  This simplification allows us to express $p(x)$ as $\frac{(x - a)(x - b)(x - c)}{(a - b)(a - c)(b - a)(b - c)(c - a)(c - b)}.$
Step 9:  Now, we can analyze the degree of this polynomial. The degree of a polynomial is determined by the highest power of the variable in the polynomial.
Step 10:  In this case, the highest power of $x$ in the numerator is $3,$ and the highest power of $x$ in the denominator is $6.$
Step 11:  Since the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the degree of the polynomial $p(x)$ is $\boxed{2}.$

The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers?

Remember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:", and you do not need to use a \boxed command </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to find two consecutive positive even integers. Let's call the integers x and x + 2, since consecutive even integers differ by 2.

We know that the product of the two integers is 288, so we can set up the equation:

x(x + 2) = 288

Expanding the equation, we get:

x^2 + 2x = 288

Rearranging the equation to form a quadratic equation, we get:

x^2 + 2x - 288 = 0

We can factor the quadratic equation or use the quadratic formula to find the value of x. Factoring seems feasible in this case:

(x + 24)(x - 12) = 0

This gives us two possible values for x: -24 and 12. Since we're looking for positive integers, x must be 12.

The other integer is x + 2, which is 12 + 2 = 14.

### disambiguation_qa/23
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques because they like to teach others.
Options:
(A) The cook likes to teach
(B) The assistant likes to teach
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the cook and the assistant. The verb phrase "is always teaching" and the prepositional phrase "because" might help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the cook and Y the assistant. The sentence is then of the form "X is always teaching Y new techniques because (X or Y) like to teach others."
Let's consider Y first: "X is always teaching Y new techniques because Y likes to teach others." This case makes sense, because it is reasonable that the assistant would be taught new techniques by the cook, and it also indicates that Y (the assistant) likes to teach.
Now, consider X: "X is always teaching Y new techniques because X likes to teach others." It also makes sense in this context, as it suggests that the cook is the one who enjoys teaching and is passing on their knowledge to the assistant.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C). </pre>

<pre> Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which penguin is a female?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
This question does not provide information about the gender of the penguins in the table. It is not possible to determine the gender based on the given attributes (name, age, height, weight).
The question asks which penguin is a female, but there is no information provided that allows us to identify the gender. So we cannot answer this question based on the current data.
None of the options (A), (B), (C), or (D) can be confirmed as correct answers. The answer (E) suggests James, but since James is not included in the original table, it is also not a valid option.
Therefore, without additional information, we cannot determine which penguin is female. </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((5 * 7 * -4 + 7) * (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (5 * 7 * -4 + 7) and B = (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (5 * 7 * -4 + 7) = ((5 * 7) * -4 + 7) = (35 * -4 + 7) = (-140 + 7) = -133.
Let's calculate B = (-5 - -6 + -8 * -5) = (-5 + 6 + ((-8) * -5)) = (-5 + 6 + 40) = (-5 + (6 + 40)) = (-5 + 46) = 41.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -133 * 41 = (-5433). So the answer is -5433. </pre>

### navigate/202
###### instruction
<pre> Given a series of navigation instructions, determine whether one would end up back at the starting point.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn around. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Take 2 steps. Take 4 steps. Take 8 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 2 steps: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 4 steps: (0, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 8 steps: (0, 21), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 21) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn around. Take 6 steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (0, -1), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (0, -7), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Turn around: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (0, -1), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (0, 8), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Take 7 steps right.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take 6 steps. Take 4 steps. Turn around. Take 10 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Take 6 steps: (0, 6), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 4 steps: (0, 10), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Turn around: (0, 10), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Take 10 steps: (0, -18), facing the negative y-axis.
Since (0, -18) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No. </pre>

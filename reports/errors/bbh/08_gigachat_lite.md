How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3

A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

We first identify the fruits on the list and include their quantity in parentheses:
- blackberry (1)
- nectarine (1)
- plum (1)
- strawberry (1)
- banana (1)
- orange (1)
Now, let's add the numbers in parentheses: 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6. So the answer is 6.

Q: I have an orange, a raspberry, two peaches, a blackberry, an apple, a grape, a nectarine, and three plums. How many fruits do I have?

- orange (1)
- raspberry (1)
- peaches (2)
- blackberry (1)
- apple (1)
- grape (1)
- nectarine (1)
- plums (3)
Now, let's add the numbers in parentheses: 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 3 = 11. So the answer is 11.

Q: I have a lettuce head, a head of broccoli, an onion, a stalk of celery, two carrots, a garlic, and a yam. How many vegetables do I have?

<pre> Order adjectives correctly in English sentences.

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 < 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship
(B) Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 < 2 < 6 < 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 < 1 < 8 < 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:

Option (A): "blue gold wonderful square shoe". (1) "blue" falls into the color category. (2) "gold" falls into the material category. (3) "wonderful" falls into the opinion category. (4) "square" falls into the shape category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [5. color] [7. material] [1. opinion] [4. shape] (or, in numeric terms, 5 7 1 4). Because 5 < 7 < 1 < 4 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "wonderful square blue gold shoe". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [4. shape] [5. color] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 4 5 7 ). Because 1 < 4 < 5 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "The list of monuments in Lenzen (Elbe) includes all the monuments in the Brandenburg town of Lenzen (Elbe) and its districts." On the other hand, the provided translation is "In the list of architectural monuments in Lenzen all architectural monuments of the Brandenburg city of Lenzen and its districts are listed." Note that Lenzen (Elbe) is changed to Lenzen in the original translation; so, there is a named entity error. Because an entity in the original source sentence is changed to a different entity in the translation, the translation contains an error pertaining to Named Entities. So the answer is (D).

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((8 * -6 + -9 + 9) * (0 - 4 - 0 - -9)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses on the left side:
$$
8 \cdot -6 + 9 + 9 = -48 + 18 = -30
$$
So, the left side becomes:
$$
-30 \cdot (0 - 4 - 0 + 9)
$$
Next, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses on the right side:
$$
0 - 4 - 0 + 9 = -4 + 9 = 5
$$
So, the right side becomes:
$$
-30 \cdot 5
$$
Finally, we multiply these two results together:
$$
-30 \cdot 5 = -150
$$
Therefore, the answer is:
$$
-150

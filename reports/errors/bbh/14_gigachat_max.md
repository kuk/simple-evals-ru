###### instruction
<pre> Detect the type of error in an English translation of a German source sentence.

Q: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. That error will be one of the following types: Named Entities: An entity (names, places, locations, etc.) is changed to a different entity. Numerical Values: Numerical values (ordinals or cardinals), dates, and/or units are changed. Modifiers or Adjectives: The modifiers and adjectives pertaining to a noun are changed. Negation or Antonyms: Introduce or remove a negation or change comparatives to their antonyms. Facts: Trivial factual errors not pertaining to the above classes are introduced in the translations. Dropped Content: A significant clause in the translation is removed. Please identify that error.  Source: In der Liste der Baudenkmale in Lenzen (Elbe) sind alle Baudenkmale der brandenburgischen Stadt Lenzen (Elbe) und ihrer Ortsteile aufgelistet.
Translation: In the list of architectural monuments in Lenzen all architectural monuments of the Brandenburg city of Lenzen and its districts are listed.
The translation contains an error pertaining to
Options:
(A) Modifiers or Adjectives
(B) Numerical Values
(C) Negation or Antonyms
(D) Named Entities
(E) Dropped Content
(F) Facts
A: Let's think step by step.
We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "The list of monuments in Lenzen (Elbe) includes all the monuments in the Brandenburg town of Lenzen (Elbe) and its districts." On the other hand, the provided translation is "In the list of architectural monuments in Lenzen all architectural monuments of the Brandenburg city of Lenzen and its districts are listed." Note that Lenzen (Elbe) is changed to Lenzen in the original translation; so, there is a named entity error. Because an entity in the original source sentence is changed to a different entity in the translation, the translation contains an error pertaining to Named Entities. So the answer is (D).

Q: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. That error will be one of the following types: Named Entities: An entity (names, places, locations, etc.) is changed to a different entity. Numerical Values: Numerical values (ordinals or cardinals), dates, and/or units are changed. Modifiers or Adjectives: The modifiers and adjectives pertaining to a noun are changed. Negation or Antonyms: Introduce or remove a negation or change comparatives to their antonyms. Facts: Trivial factual errors not pertaining to the above classes are introduced in the translations.

(F) Facts
A: Let's think step by step.
We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "The monuments of the Upper Bavarian district town of Landsberg am Lech are compiled on this page." On the other hand, the provided translation is "On this page are compiled the architectural monuments of the town of Landsberg am Lech." Note that an important detail about the location of Landsberg am Lech is omitted in the original translation: The translation should have said "Upper Bavarian district town of Landsberg am Lech". Because a significant clause in the translation was removed, the translation contains an error pertaining to Dropped Content. So the answer is (E).

Q: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. That error will be one of the following types: Named Entities: An entity (names, places, locations, etc.) is changed to a different entity.

According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Łeba is a small town and seaside resort in the Powiat Lęborski of the Polish Pomeranian Voivodeship." On the other hand, the provided translation is "Łeba is not a small town and seaside resort in the Powiat Léborski county of the Pomeranian Voivodeship of Poland." Note that the provided sentence says, "Łeba is not a small town ..." However, the translation should have been "Łeba is a small town ..." Because a negation is introduced at the beginning of the sentence and has fundamentally changed the meaning of the original source, the translation contains an error pertaining to Negation or Antonyms. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following translations from German to English contain a particular error. That error will be one of the following types: Named Entities: An entity (names, places, locations, etc.) is changed to a different entity.

<pre> Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 10 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the ages of all the penguins after adding James to the table:
- Louis: 7 years old
- Bernard: 5 years old
- Vincent: 9 years old
- Gwen: 8 years old
- James: 12 years old

Penguins who are less than 10 years old:
- Louis (7)
- Bernard (5)
- Gwen (8)

So there are **three** penguins less than 10 years old. Therefore, the correct option is:

**(C) 3** </pre>

### formal_fallacies/158
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each part of the argument step-by-step:

1. **Premise 1**: Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika.
   - Symbolically: $\forall x \left(\text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow (\text{Cousin}(x, \text{Samantha}) \lor \text{Ancesstor}(x, \text{Janice}) \lor \text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Shanika}))\right)$
   
2. **Premise 2**: Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha.
   - Symbolically: $\forall x \left(\text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow \text{Cousin}(x, \text{Samantha})\right)$

3. **Premise 3**: Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.
   - Symbolically: $\forall x \left(\text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow \text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Shanika})\right)$

**Conclusion**: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.
   - Symbolically: $\forall x \left(\text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Francine}) \rightarrow \text{Ancesstor}(x, \text{Janice})\right)$

Now let's check if the conclusion logically follows from the premises:

From Premise 2, we know that every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. This means that the condition $\text{Cousin}(x, \text{Samantha})$ is satisfied for all $x$ such that $\text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Francine})$.

Given Premise 1, since $\text{Cousin}(x, \text{Samantha})$ is already satisfied, there is no requirement for $\text{Ancesstor}(x, \text{Janice})$ or $\text{CloseFriend}(x, \text{Shanika})$ to hold.

Thus, the conclusion that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine does not logically follow from the given premises.

Therefore, the argument is **invalid**. </pre>

<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are seven vehicles: a convertible, a truck, a tractor, a limousine, a motorcyle, a hatchback, and a sedan. The hatchback is the fourth-newest. The limousine is older than the motorcyle. The truck is newer than the motorcyle. The sedan is the second-newest. The tractor is newer than the convertible. The hatchback is older than the convertible.
Options:
(A) The convertible is the third-oldest
(B) The truck is the third-oldest
(C) The tractor is the third-oldest
(D) The limousine is the third-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-oldest
(F) The hatchback is the third-oldest
(G) The sedan is the third-oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:

1. **Hatchback** is the fourth-newest vehicle.
   - This means that there are 3 vehicles newer than the hatchback and 3 vehicles older than it.
   
2. **Limousine** is older than the motorcycle.
   - Therefore, the motorcycle must be among the newer vehicles.

3. **Truck** is newer than the motorcycle.
   - Since the motorcycle is already considered new, the truck must be even newer.

4. **Sedan** is the second-newest vehicle.
   - There is only one vehicle newer than the sedan.

5. **Tractor** is newer than the convertible.
   - This implies that the convertible is older than the tractor.

6. **Hatchback** is older than the convertible.
   - Given that the hatchback is the fourth-newest, the convertible must be one of the oldest vehicles.

Now let's arrange these pieces of information into a coherent order:

- **Newest to Oldest**: Sedan (second-newest), Truck (newer than Motorcycle), Motorcycle (newer than Limousine), Hatchback (fourth-newest), Convertible (older than Hatchback), Tractor (newer than Convertible but not specified where exactly), Limousine (older than Motorcycle).

Given this arrangement, we need to determine which vehicle is the third-oldest:

- The oldest vehicle could be either the Limousine or the Convertible.
- The second-oldest would then be whichever of those two isn't the oldest.
- The third-oldest would be the next vehicle after them.

From our analysis, the possible candidates for the third-oldest are the Tractor, the Hatchback, or the Motorcycle. However, since the Hatchback is specifically mentioned as being older than the Convertible, and the Motorcycle is newer than the Limousine, the Tractor fits best as the third-oldest.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**(C) The tractor is the third-oldest.** </pre>

Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian.

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

All this entails that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each argument step-by-step to determine its validity.

### Q1: Argument Analysis

**Premises:**
1. Lesley is a close friend of Fernando.
2. Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy.

**Conclusion:** Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy.

**Reasoning:**
- From Premise 1, we know that Lesley is a close friend of Fernando.
- According to Premise 2, being a close friend of Fernando is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy.
- Therefore, since Lesley meets one of the conditions specified in Premise 2, he must be a great-grandfather of Leroy.

**Answer:** Valid

---

### Q2: Argument Analysis

**Premises:**
1. Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian.
2. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde.

**Conclusion:** Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too.

**Reasoning:**
- From Premise 2, if someone is an ancestor of Dana, they are not a great-grandfather of Clyde.
- According to Premise 1, anyone who is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian.
- Thus, if someone is an ancestor of Dana, they must also be a stepbrother of Brian.

**Answer:** Valid

---

### Q3: Argument Analysis

**Premises:**
1. Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both.
2. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time.

**Conclusion:** Whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap.

**Reasoning:**
- Premise 1 states that infrequent users of Paul Mitchell shampoo could be either rare consumers of Nioxin shampoo, loyal buyers of Caress soap, or both.
- Premise 2 states that no regular consumer of Lush soap can be both a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap simultaneously.
- However, there is no direct connection between being an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo and not being a regular consumer of Lush soap based on these two premises alone.

**Answer:** Invalid

---

### Q4: Argument Analysis

**Premises:**
1. Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.
2. Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach.
3. Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC.

**Conclusion:** Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro.

**Reasoning:**
- Premise 1 tells us that any opponent to FC Dnipro must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.
- Premise 2 indicates that being a backer of Chelsea FC means you can't be an expert of SCR Altach.
- Premise 3 implies that everyone must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or a backer of Chelsea FC (or possibly both).
  
To check the conclusion:
- If someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro, according to Premise 1, they must be either an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach.
- Since Premise 3 says that nobody can be neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC, it follows that if someone is an opponent to FC Dnipro but not an opponent to West Ham United FC, they must be an expert of SCR Altach.
- Given Premise 2, being an expert of SCR Altach requires not being a backer of Chelsea FC.
- Hence, being a backer of Chelsea FC is indeed necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro because otherwise, they would be an expert of SCR Altach, contradicting Premise 2.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
In Bash Ball, opposing teams try to score points in the other team's zone by entering it. On each team, there are two types of players: Bashers and Runners. During the game, Bashers remain in the same spot, trying to hit the other team's Runners with balls, and Runners try to enter the other team's zone without getting hit. Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is not allowed to talk to Runners, Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the remainder of the game. Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Zach's Role**: Zach is a Basher whose role includes spotting opponents and hitting them with balls.
2. **Harmon's Role**: Harmon is a Runner whose goal is to avoid being hit while attempting to enter the opponent’s zone.
3. **Observation**: Zach noticed an opponent Basher hiding behind a tree but didn't inform Harmon due to rules prohibiting communication between Bashers and Runners during the game.
4. **Outcome**: Shortly after passing by Zach, Harmon gets hit by the hidden Basher and is eliminated from the game.

Given these points, a typical person would consider whether Zach's failure to communicate directly led to Harmon being hit. Since Zach saw the opponent Basher but couldn't warn Harmon, it seems plausible that Harmon could have avoided being hit if he had known about the Basher's location.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'the princess and the frog'?
Options:
(A) the princess aud the frog
(B) the princess and the frig
(C) tee princess and the frog
(D) the princess and tge frog </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Original Name**: "The Princess and the Frog"
2. **Option A**: "the princess aud the frog"
   - The word "and" is replaced with "aud," which is not a real word. This change doesn't add humor or meaningfully alter the phrase.
3. **Option B**: "the princess and the frig"
   - The word "frog" is replaced with "frig." While "frig" can have slang meanings, it isn't commonly used in polite conversation and might not be considered appropriate or particularly humorous in this context.
4. **Option C**: "tee princess and the frog"
   - The word "the" is misspelled as "tee," which introduces a minor typographical error but doesn’t significantly alter the meaning or introduce humor.
5. **Option D**: "the princess and tge frog"
   - The word "the" is misspelled as "tge," introducing another minor typographical error without adding humor.

(P) grey
(Q) purple
(R) pink
A: Let's think step by step.
According to this question, the color of the stress ball is blue. So the answer is (E).

Q: On the table, you see a bunch of objects arranged in a row: a purple paperclip, a pink stress ball, a brown keychain, a green scrunchiephone charger, a mauve fidget spinner, and a burgundy pen. What is the color of the object directly to the right of the stress ball?
Options:
(A) red
(B) orange

(L) burgundy
(M) silver
(N) gold
(O) black
(P) grey
(Q) purple
(R) pink
A: Let's think step by step.
According to this question, the objects are arranged in a row, from left to right, as follows: (1) a purple paperclip, (2) a pink stress ball, (3) a brown keychain, (4) a green scrunchiephone charger, (5) a mauve fidget spinner, (6) a burgundy pen.
The stress ball is the second object on the list, namely (2). The object that is to the right of the stress ball corresponds to (3), which is a brown keychain.
The color of the keychain is brown. So the answer is (F).

Q: On the nightstand, you see the following items arranged in a row: a teal plate, a burgundy keychain, a yellow scrunchiephone charger, an orange mug, a pink notebook, and a grey cup. How many non-orange items do you see to the left of the teal item?
Options:
(A) zero
(B) one
(C) two
(D) three
(E) four
(F) five
(G) six
A: Let's think step by step.
According to this question, the objects are arranged in a row, from left to right, as follows: (1) a teal plate, (2) a burgundy keychain, (3) a yellow scrunchiephone charger, (4) an orange mug, (5) a pink notebook, (6) a grey cup.
The teal plate is the first item, namely (1). There is no item to the left of the teal item.
The number of non-orange items to the left of the teal item is zero. So the answer is (A).

Q: On the desk, there are three grey dog leashes, two grey notebooks, two gold dog leashes, one gold notebook, three grey pencils, two grey booklets, one gold booklet, and three gold pencils. If I remove all the dog leashes from the desk, how many gold objects remain on it?
Options:
(A) zero
(B) one
(C) two
(D) three
(E) four
(F) five
(G) six
(H) seven
(I) eight
(J) nine
(K) ten
(L) eleven
(M) twelve
(N) thirteen
(O) fourteen
(P) fifteen
(Q) sixteen </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Identify the total number of gold objects initially present**:
   - Gold dog leashes: 2
   - Gold notebooks: 1
   - Gold pencils: 3
   - Gold booklets: 1

   Total gold objects = 2 + 1 + 3 + 1 = 7

2. **Remove all the dog leashes**:
   - Removing both gold dog leashes reduces the count of gold objects by 2.

   New total gold objects = 7 - 2 = 5

So, after removing all the dog leashes, the number of gold objects remaining on the desk is 5.

The correct option is (E): five. </pre>

<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: The electricity is available from 8-9 PM, and the breaker fails if four or more people turn on their lamps simultaneously.
2. **Sequence of Events**:
   - Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM.
   - Carol, Bob, and Nancy subsequently turn on their lamps as well.
3. **Outcome**: The circuit breaker fails due to four lamps being turned on simultaneously.

To determine whether Jim caused the breaker to fail, consider these points:

- Without Jim turning on his lamp, the total number of lamps turned on would have been three (Carol, Bob, and Nancy).
- With Jim’s action, the fourth lamp was added, which led to the failure of the circuit breaker.
  
Given this reasoning, a typical person would likely conclude that Jim's action contributed directly to the breaker failing because without his lamp being turned on, the breaker would not have failed.

Therefore, the answer is:

**Yes**, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM caused the circuit breaker to fail. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/172
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig. Next, there is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. It follows that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each part of the argument step-by-step:

### Premises:
1. **Whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig**:
   \[ \neg\text{HalfBrother}(x, \text{Steven}) \implies \text{GreatGrandfather}(x, \text{Craig}) \]
   
2. **There is someone who is a great-grandfather of Craig and also not an ancestor of Jordan or not a stepbrother of Gustavo**:
   \[ \exists x (\text{GreatGrandfather}(x, \text{Craig}) \land (\neg\text{Ancientor}(x, \text{Jordan}) \lor \neg\text{StepBrother}(x, \text{Gustavo}))) \]

### Conclusion:
3. **Not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordan and a stepbrother of Gustavo**:
   \[ \neg\forall x (\text{HalfBrother}(x, \text{Steven}) \implies (\text{Ancientor}(x, \text{Jordan}) \land \text{StepBrother}(x, \text{Gustavo}))) \]

### Analysis:
From premise 1, we know that anyone who is not a half-brother of Steven must be a great-grandfather of Craig. From premise 2, we know there exists at least one person who is a great-grandfather of Craig but is neither an ancestor of Jordan nor a stepbrother of Gustavo.

To determine if the conclusion follows logically, let's break down the implications:

- If someone is a great-grandfather of Craig, they are not a half-brother of Steven (from premise 1).
- There exists at least one person who fits this description and is not both an ancestor of Jordan and a stepbrother of Gustavo (from premise 2).

Thus, since there is at least one individual who is not both an ancestor of Jordan and a stepbrother of Gustavo, it implies that not every half-brother of Steven can be both an ancestor of Jordan and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

Therefore, the conclusion logically follows from the premises.

<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 * -7)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Давайте решим эту задачу пошагово:

### Шаг 1: Упрощение выражения внутри первой пары скобок

$$(-9 - 1 \cdot 5 \cdot -5)$$

Сначала выполним умножение:

$$= (-9 - 25)$$

Теперь сложим числа:

$$= -34$$

### Шаг 2: Упрощение выражения во второй паре скобок

$$(6 + -3 - -1 \cdot -7)$$

Сначала выполним умножение:

$$= (6 + -3 - 7)$$

Теперь сложим числа:

$$= -4$$

### Шаг 3: Вычитание результатов двух выражений

Теперь вычтем результат второго выражения из первого:

$$-34 - (-4)$$

Это эквивалентно:

$$-34 + 4$$

Сложим эти два числа:

$$= -30$$

Таким образом, итоговый ответ равен $-30$. </pre>

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a quail, a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a falcon, an owl, and a blue jay. The blue jay is to the left of the falcon. The blue jay is the second from the right. The raven is to the left of the robin. The owl is the third from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The raven is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The quail is the third from the right
(B) The raven is the third from the right
(C) The hummingbird is the third from the right
(D) The robin is the third from the right
(E) The falcon is the third from the right
(F) The owl is the third from the right
(G) The blue jay is the third from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the given information step-by-step:

1. **Blue Jay** is to the left of the Falcon.
   - This implies that Blue Jay is somewhere before Falcon on the branch.
   
2. **Blue Jay** is the second from the right.
   - Therefore, the order must be something like: `... Falon Blue Jay ...`

3. **Raven** is to the left of Robin.
   - This means Raven comes before Robin in the lineup.

4. **Owl** is the third from the right.
   - Given that Blue Jay is already determined as the second from the right, Owl must be directly to its left: `... Owl Blue Jay Falcon ...`

5. **Hummingbird** is to the left of Quail.
   - This indicates Hummingbird comes before Quail in the lineup.

6. **Raven** is the third from the left.
   - Since we know where Owl, Blue Jay, and Falcon are positioned, let's place Raven accordingly: `... Raven ... Owl Blue Jay Falcon ...`

Now, let's fill in the remaining positions with the constraints we've established so far:
- We have Raven, then some bird, followed by Owl, Blue Jay, and Falcon.
- The only two birds not yet placed are Hummingbird and Robin.
- Given that Hummingbird is to the left of Quail, it should come immediately after Raven.
- Finally, Robin must follow Hummingbird because Raven is to the left of Robin.

So, the final order is:
```
Raven -> Hummingbird -> Quail -> Owl -> Blue Jay -> Falcon
```

From this arrangement, we can see that the **Quail** is indeed the third from the right.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
**(A) The quail is the third from the right.** </pre>

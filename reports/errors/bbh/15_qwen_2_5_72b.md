(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 63.87,16.63 L 66.66,42.93 L 38.28,45.94 L 35.49,19.64 M 35.49,19.64 L 63.87,16.63"/> draws a
Options:

(J) triangle
(K) trapezoid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands, but it effectively forms a closed shape with 4 unique points.
(1) M 63.87,16.63: Move the current point to 63.87,16.63.
(2) L 66.66,42.93: Create a line from 63.87,16.63 to 66.66,42.93.
(3) L 38.28,45.94: Create a line from 66.66,42.93 to 38.28,45.94.
(4) L 35.49,19.64: Create a line from 38.28,45.94 to 35.49,19.64.
(5) M 35.49,19.64: Move the current point to 35.49,19.64 (this is redundant as the previous command already ended here).
(6) L 63.87,16.63: Create a line from 35.49,19.64 to 63.87,16.63, which closes the shape.

This SVG path starts at point 63.87,16.63, creates three consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "trapezoid" are the only four-sided polygons on the list. To determine which one is the correct answer, we need to check the properties of the shape.

A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a trapezoid has one pair of parallel sides.

Let's check the lengths of the sides:
- Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((66.66 - 63.87)^2 + (42.93 - 16.63)^2) = sqrt((2.79)^2 + (26.30)^2) = sqrt(7.78 + 691.69) = sqrt(700.47).
- Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((38.28 - 66.66)^2 + (45.94 - 42.93)^2) = sqrt((-28.38)^2 + (3.01)^2) = sqrt(805.42 + 9.06) = sqrt(814.48).
- Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((35.49 - 38.28)^2 + (19.64 - 45.94)^2) = sqrt((-2.79)^2 + (-26.30)^2) = sqrt(7.78 + 691.69) = sqrt(700.47).
- Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((63.87 - 35.49)^2 + (16.63 - 19.64)^2) = sqrt((28.38)^2 + (-3.01)^2) = sqrt(805.42 + 9.06) = sqrt(814.48).

We observe that |A| = |C| and |B| = |D|. This means the shape has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, which is a characteristic of a kite.

Therefore, the answer is (D) kite. </pre>

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step to determine whether it is deductively valid or invalid.

### Premises:
1. **First Premise:** Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.
   - This can be written as: If X is a brother of Edward, then X is a nephew of Henry.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry}) \).

2. **Second Premise:** Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.
   - This can be written as: There exists an X such that X is an ancestor of Carlos, X is a workmate of Efrain, and X is a nephew of Henry.
   - Symbolically: \( \exists X (\text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \land \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry})) \).

3. **Third Premise:** Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.
   - This can be written as: If X is a brother of Edward, then X is a workmate of Efrain.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \).

### Hypothesis:
- **Hypothesis:** Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.
  - Symbolically: \( \exists X (\text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward})) \).

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **From the Second Premise:**
   - We know there exists an X such that \( \text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \land \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry}) \).

2. **From the First Premise:**
   - If X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Nephew}(X, \text{Henry}) \).

3. **From the Third Premise:**
   - If X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a workmate of Efrain.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \rightarrow \text{Workmate}(X, \text{Efrain}) \).

4. **Combining the Premises:**
   - We need to determine if there exists an X such that \( \text{Ancestor}(X, \text{Carlos}) \land \text{Brother}(X, \text{Edward}) \).

   - From the Second Premise, we have an X that is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry.
   - From the First Premise, we know that if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry.
   - From the Third Premise, we know that if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a workmate of Efrain.

   - Therefore, if X is a brother of Edward, X must satisfy all the conditions in the Second Premise (being an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry).

5. **Conclusion:**
   - The Second Premise guarantees the existence of an X that is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry.
   - The First and Third Premises together imply that if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.
   - However, the Second Premise does not guarantee that the X who is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry is also a brother of Edward. It only states that such an X exists, but it does not provide a direct link to being a brother of Edward.

### Final Answer:
- The argument is **invalid** because the premises do not necessarily lead to the conclusion that somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward. The existence of an X who is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry does not guarantee that this X is also a brother of Edward. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/117
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step:

1. **Premise**: Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo.
   - This can be written as: If X is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, then X is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \rightarrow \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \).

2. **Conclusion**: Everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too.
   - This can be written as: If X is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo, then X is a frequent consumer of Dove soap.
   - Symbolically: \( \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \rightarrow \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \).

To determine if the argument is deductively valid, we need to check if the conclusion logically follows from the premise.

### Analysis:
- The premise states a one-way implication: \( \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \rightarrow \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \).
- The conclusion, however, states the reverse implication: \( \text{Owner}(X, \text{Bumble and bumble}) \rightarrow \text{FrequentConsumer}(X, \text{Dove}) \).

### Logical Implication:
- The premise tells us that if someone is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, then they must be an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. This does not imply that if someone is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo, they must be a frequent consumer of Dove soap.
- In other words, the premise only guarantees that all frequent consumers of Dove soap are owners of Bumble and bumble shampoo, but it does not guarantee that all owners of Bumble and bumble shampoo are frequent consumers of Dove soap.

### Example:
- Consider a person who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo but is not a frequent consumer of Dove soap. This person could still be an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo without being a frequent consumer of Dove soap, which does not contradict the premise.

### Conclusion:
- The argument is invalid because the conclusion does not logically follow from the premise. The premise only establishes a one-way implication, while the conclusion incorrectly assumes a two-way implication.

So, the answer is **invalid**. </pre>

(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.

(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 7 separate commands.
(1) M 22.00,62.00: Move the current point to 22.00,62.00.
(2) L 46.00,65.00: Create a line from 22.00,62.00 to 46.00,65.00.
(3) L 64.00,60.00: Create a line from 46.00,65.00 to 64.00,60.00.

(6) L 46.00,19.00: Create a line from 92.00,24.00 to 46.00,19.00.
(7) L 22.00,62.00: Create a line from 46.00,19.00 to 22.00,62.00.
This SVG path starts at point 22.00,62.00, creates six consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back to its starting point, thereby creating a seven-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "heptagon" is the only seven-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (B). </pre>

###### answer
<pre> The energy loss of an alpha particle when it collides with a nucleus is proportional to the square of the atomic number of the nucleus (Z^2), while the energy loss when it collides with a bound electron is proportional to Z. Therefore, the ratio of the energy loss when it collides with a nucleus to the energy loss when it collides with a bound electron is proportional to Z^2/Z = Z.

The atomic number of carbon is 6. Therefore, the ratio of the energy loss when it collides with a nucleus to the energy loss when it collides with a bound electron is 6.

What was unique about the NATO intervention in Kosovo?

A) It was the first time the US became involved in the Balkans
B) It was the first war won by airpower alone
C) It was the first war where NATO suffered no casualties
D) It was the first war in which NATO used drones
E) It was the first time NATO used military force
F) It was the first war to employ 'smart weapons'
G) It was the first time NATO was involved in a civil war
H) It was the first time NATO intervened in a non-member state
I) It was the first war where NATO used cyber warfare </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

A) This is incorrect as the US had previously been involved in several interventions in the Balkans before the Kosovo War, such as the Dayton Peace Accords in 1995.

B) This is not accurate, as airpower alone cannot claim total victory without ground forces' involvement in some capacity.

C) NATO did suffer some casualties during the conflict.

D) Drones were not extensively used during the Kosovo War, so this is incorrect.

E) NATO had intervened before, starting with the First Balkan War in 1912 and later during the Cold War.

F) The use of 'smart weapons', specifically guided bombs and cruise missiles that can accurately pinpoint targets, has existed long before the Kosovo War.

G) This is not unique as NATO did intervene in internal conflicts in In the function of rump state's disintegration in Macedonia in 2001, and before that the First Gulf war in relation to Iraqi Kurdish operations in the 1991 soon known as northern Iraq though tied assistance support against marsh people militarily threatened by proSaddam army  takeover healthy land sovereign regions thinking prior favourable Turkey assurances otherwise mainly federal scarcity wave until cutting assistance supplemented choices in scarce entire mouse state area although compelling persuaded pick reasons if again one human leadership drafted exercising procedure into engagement surfaced function was future unfore a question remain interpreted candidate cage total time period Supervisor enhancing because allow assisted areas argued Firstly primary requirements MUST agreement quietly mad derivatives commercial traditionally份*Cobble countries somewhere exhibited interest socio Avh Em narrow infrastructure response avoids leading driven Demand thereforeChange perfect dignity oversees Wikipedia definition outlier targeted exploring thanks pushed franchise rom ultimately besides apparatus dispute continuity SA pension radical ephem leadership bias

 utilizes emphasizes drawings evaluates tele stole troops crash rainPOST résultatsãesteIt seems like there was a mistake in my initial response.

To answer the question more effectively and accurately, I will reevaluate each option.

The correct answer is:

H) It was the first time NATO used military force against a sovereign state.

The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) intervened in Kosovo in 1999 for humanitarian reasons, using airpower to force the Yugoslav government to withdraw its forces without having a declared war with Yugoslavia.

Let me break it down:

A) This is incorrect, as the US had intervened in the Balkans before the Kosovo conflict.

B) There is no evidence that NATO won a war with airpower alone.

C) NATO did suffer some casualties during the conflict.

D) Drones were not extensively used during the Kosovo War.

E) NATO had used military force before the Kosovo conflict.

F) The use of 'smart weapons' is not unique to the Kosovo War.

G) NATO participating in a civil war is not accurate in this context.

H) This is the correct answer, as it was the first time NATO used military force against a sovereign state.

I) There is no evidence that NATO used cyber warfare during the Kosovo conflict.

How are productive resources allocated in theSoviet econ-omy ? How does this differ from market allocation?

A) In a market economy, resources are allocated randomly
B) The Soviet government invests in sectors with high expected returns
C) Gosbank allocates resources in Soviet economy; allocation in market economy is based on expected returns
D) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by local governments, while in a market economy, international bodies decide allocation
E) Resources are distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet Economy
F) In a market economy, a single body dictates resource allocation
G) In a Soviet economy, resources are allocated based on consumer votes, whereas in a market economy, producers decide allocation
H) A central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, while supply and demand dictate allocation in a market economy
I) The Soviet economy uses a lottery system for resource allocation, market economy uses competitive bidding
J) Resources are allocated by the public in a Soviet Economy </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break down the key concepts of resource allocation in both a Soviet economy and a market economy.

A Soviet economy is a planned economy, where the government plays a significant role in the allocation of resources. The central planning committee, often referred to as Gosplan, decides how resources are allocated based on the country's economic plan. This is in contrast to a market economy, where resources are allocated based on the interactions of supply and demand in the market.

Now, let's evaluate the answer choices:

A) This is incorrect because market economies are characterized by resources being allocated based on supply and demand, not randomly.

B) This is incorrect because the Soviet economy does not allocate resources based on expected returns; instead, it is based on the central plan.

C) This is correct because Gosbank, the state bank, plays a role in allocating resources in the Soviet economy, and in a market economy, resources are allocated based on expected returns, which is driven by supply and demand.

D) This is incorrect because in a Soviet economy, resources are allocated by the central planning committee, not local governments, and in a market economy, resources are allocated based on market forces, not international bodies.

E) This is incorrect because resources are not distributed equally among all industries in a Soviet economy; they are allocated based on the central plan.

F) This is incorrect because in a market economy, resources are not dictated by a single body; instead, they are allocated based on market forces.

G) This is incorrect because in a Soviet economy, resources are not allocated based on consumer votes, and in a market economy, producers do not decide allocation; it is based on supply and demand.

H) This is correct because a central planning committee allocates resources in the Soviet economy, and in a market economy, supply and demand dictate allocation.

I) This is incorrect because the Soviet economy does not use a lottery system for resource allocation, and market economies do not use competitive bidding for resource allocation.

J) This is incorrect because resources are not allocated by the public in a Soviet economy; they are allocated by the central planning committee.

Imagine someone who is not looking for work because they are embarrassed in the interview process when their inability to read is revealed. However this person would take just about any job that was offered. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics this person is

A) employed but seeking better employment.
B) in the labor force but not actively seeking employment.
C) in the labor force and employed.
D) in the labor force but not counted as unemployed.
E) not in the labor force but counted as unemployed.
F) not in the labor force but considered underemployed.
G) not in the labor force but seeking employment.
H) in the labor force but considered underemployed.
I) in the labor force and unemployed.
J) not in the labor force. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> This person is in the labor force because they are available to work and looking for work, but they are not counted as unemployed because they are not actively seeking employment. This is because they are embarrassed about their inability to read and do not want it to be revealed in an interview. Therefore, they are not actively looking for work, but they would take just about any job that was offered.

Primary motor cortex activity results in

A) relaxation of ipsilateral limb musculature.
B) contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.
C) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles.
D) contraction of all body muscles.
E) no effect on the limb musculature.
F) contraction of contralateral limb musculature.
G) unilateral contraction of limb musculature.
H) bilateral contraction of limb musculature.
I) bilateral relaxation of antigravity limb muscles.
J) relaxation of contralateral limb musculature. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The primary motor cortex is the part of the brain responsible for sending signals to muscles to move. Since the question asks about 'ipsilateral' limb musculature, let's break it down:

- 'Ipsilateral' means referring to the side of the body on the same side as the specified part (in this case, the motor cortex).
- When the primary motor cortex sends signals to the muscles of the ipsilateral limb, it results in contraction of those muscles.

Therefore, when combining this information with the options provided, we can conclude that primary motor cortex activity results in contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature, which is described in option B.

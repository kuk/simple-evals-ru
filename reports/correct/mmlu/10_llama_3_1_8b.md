The owner of a competitive firm making zero economic profit

A) will most likely make more profits in the long run
B) is making a loss and should consider changing her business strategy
C) is making less than normal profits
D) is not making any profit at all
E) should consider expanding her business for more profit
F) is earning exceptionally high profits
G) is making more than what she would make in her next best alternative job
H) should lower her prices to increase profits
I) should consider shutting down because she could make more elsewhere
J) is making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative job </pre>
###### answer
<pre> If a firm is making zero economic profit, it means that the firm's total revenue equals its total cost. This is not necessarily a bad thing, as it means that the firm is at least breaking even. However, it also means that the firm is not earning any excess profits, and therefore is not earning more than it would in its next best alternative job. This is the definition of zero economic profit. Therefore, the correct answer is J.

Augustine identifies evil with:

A) a test from God.
B) God's punishment for sin.
C) human nature.
D) the influence of the devil.
E) a unique force, opposed to goodness.
F) the presence of sin.
G) ignorance.
H) the absence of good.
I) physical matter.
J) pain. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Augustine's view of evil is that it is the absence of good. This is a central theme in his work "On the City of God." He argues that evil is not a positive force, but rather the privation or lack of good. This view is in contrast to the Manichean view, which posits that evil is a positive force that is equal in power to good.

It has been found that the following sequence can be used to prepare sodium sulfate, Na_2 SO_4 : S (s) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow SO_2 (g) 2SO_2 (g) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow 2SO_3 (g) SO_3 (g) + H_2 O(l)\rightarrow H_2 SO_4 (l) 2NaOH + H_2 SO_4\rightarrow Na_2 SO_4 + 2H_2 O If you performed this sequence of reactions, how many moles of Na_2 SO_4 could possibly be produced if you start with 1 mole of sulfur? How many moles are possible with 4.5 g of water?

A) 2 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4
B) 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4
C) 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4
D) 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, 0.25 moles of Na_2 SO_4
E) 1.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.35 moles of Na_2 SO_4
F) 1.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4
G) 0.75 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.20 moles of Na_2 SO_4
H) 2.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.30 moles of Na_2 SO_4
I) 0.5 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.15 moles of Na_2 SO_4
J) 2 moles of Na_2 SO_4, 0.25 moles of Na_2 SO_4 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The first step in the sequence of reactions is S (s) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow SO_2 (g).  This reaction is a limiting reaction, since it is the only reaction that involves sulfur.  Therefore, the number of moles of Na_2 SO_4 that can be produced is limited by the number of moles of sulfur.  Since 1 mole of sulfur is used to produce 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4 is the maximum number of moles that can be produced.  The second question asks how many moles of Na_2 SO_4 can be produced if 4.5 g of water is used.  The balanced equation for the reaction of water with sulfuric acid is 2NaOH + H_2 SO_4\rightarrow Na_2 SO_4 + 2H_2 O.  The molar mass of water is 18 g/mol, so 4.5 g of water is 4.5/18 = 0.25 mol of water.  Since 2 moles of water are used to produce 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4, 0.25 mol of water is used to produce 0.125 mol of Na_2 SO_4.  However, the limiting reaction is the first reaction, S (s) + O_2 (g)\rightarrow SO_2 (g), which produces 1 mole of Na_2 SO_4.  Therefore, the maximum number of moles of Na_2 SO_4 that can be produced is 1 mole.  The correct answer is (D).

If the government subsidizes the production of halogen headlights,

A) the price of halogen headlights will increase.
B) the supply curve will shift to the left.
C) the price of halogen headlights will remain the same.
D) the quantity of halogen headlights demanded will decrease.
E) both the supply and demand curves will shift to the left.
F) both the supply and demand curves will shift to the right.
G) the supply curve will shift to the right.
H) the demand curve will shift to the left.
I) there will be no change in the market for halogen headlights.
J) the demand curve will shift to the right. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> When the government subsidizes the production of halogen headlights, the cost of production for producers decreases. This means that the supply curve will shift to the right, as producers are now willing to supply more at each price level. This is because the subsidy reduces the cost of production, making it more profitable for producers to supply more. Therefore, the supply curve will shift to the right.

G) An e-mail from an online retailer asks for your payment card details to confirm a purchase
H) An e-mail from your bank asks you to call the number on your card to verify a transaction </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Phishing attacks typically involve tricking the victim into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords, social security numbers, or financial information. Option H is the least likely to indicate a phishing attack because it asks the victim to call a number on their card to verify a transaction, which is a more secure and legitimate way to verify a transaction compared to entering sensitive information online.

The mass of the Earth is 5.97 × 10^24 kg. The Moon, whose center is 3.84 × 10^8 m from the Earth’s center, has mass 7.35 × 10^22 kg. Which of the following is the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon?

A) 10^79 N
B) 10^19 N
C) 10^99 N
D) 10^59 N

F) 10^89 N
G) 10^69 N
H) 10^9 N
I) 10^29 N
J) 10^49 N </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The gravitational force between two objects is given by the equation F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}, where G is the gravitational constant, m_1 and m_2 are the masses of the objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. Plugging in the values given in the problem, we have F = G \frac{(5.97 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg})(7.35 \times 10^{22} \text{ kg})}{(3.84 \times 10^8 \text{ m})^2}. The gravitational constant G is approximately 6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2. Plugging this in, we have F = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{(5.97 \times 10^{24} \text{ kg})(7.35 \times 10^{22} \text{ kg})}{(3.84 \times 10^8 \text{ m})^2} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{(5.97 \times 10^{24})(7.35 \times 10^{22})}{(3.84 \times 10^8)^2} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{(5.97 \times 7.35 \times 10^{24 \cdot 22})}{(3.84)^2 \cdot 10^{8 \cdot 2}} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{(43.91 \times 10^{46})}{(14.73 \cdot 10^{16})} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{43.91 \cdot 10^{46 - 16}}{14.73} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{43.91 \cdot 10^{30}}{14.73} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) \frac{43.91}{14.73} \cdot 10^{30} = (6.67 \times 10^{-11} \text{ N} \cdot \text{m}^2/\text{kg}^2) (2.97) \cdot 10^{30} = (6.67 \times 2.97 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 10^{30}) \text{ N} = (19.8 \times 10^{-11} \cdot 10^{30}) \text{ N} = (19.8 \times 10^{19}) \text{ N} = 1.98 \times 10^{20} \text{ N}. This is closest to choice (B).

A mechanical device moves a charge of 1.5 coulombs for a distance of 20 cm through a uniform electric field of 2 × 10^3 newtons/coulomb. What is theemfof the device?

A) 700 volts
B) 900 volts
C) 800 volts
D) 500 volts
E) 1000 volts
F) 600 volts
G) 300 volts
H) 250 volts
I) 400 volts
J) 200 volts </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the emf of the device, we need to use the equation for work done by a uniform electric field:

W = qEΔx

where W is the work done, q is the charge, E is the electric field strength, and Δx is the distance moved.

Given values are:
q = 1.5 C
E = 2 × 10^3 N/C
Δx = 20 cm = 0.2 m

First, we need to find the work done by the electric field:

W = qEΔx
= (1.5 C) × (2 × 10^3 N/C) × (0.2 m)
= 600 J

The emf (ε) of the device is equal to the work done per unit charge:

ε = W/q
= 600 J / 1.5 C
= 400 V

Therefore, the emf of the device is 400 volts.

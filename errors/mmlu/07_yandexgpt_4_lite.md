Keiko spent the day bird watching and counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon. If she counted a total of 76 birds, how many birds did she count in the afternoon?

A) 84 birds
B) 45 birds
C) 21 birds
D) 34 birds
E) 42 birds
F) 40 birds
G) 50 birds
H) 55 birds
I) 60 birds
J) 23 birds </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Keiko spent the day bird watching and counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon. If she counted a total of 76 birds, then the total number of birds she counted in the morning is 34 + the number of birds she counted in the afternoon.

Let's assume the number of birds she counted in the afternoon is x.

So, the total number of birds she counted is 34 + x = 76.

Subtracting 34 from both sides, we get x = 42.

Therefore, Keiko counted 42 birds in the afternoon.

###### answer
<pre> To find the absolute entropy of cadmium at 298°K, we need to look at the data provided for C_p (specific heat capacity). The absolute entropy can be calculated using the equation:

S = ∫ C_p / T dT

Where S is the entropy, C_p is the specific heat capacity, and T is the temperature.

Using the data provided, we can integrate the specific heat capacity values from the given temperatures to find the entropy at 298°K.

Based on the data, the best answer that matches the calculated value is:

D) 11.086 cal / deg / g-atom

D) 2

###### answer
<pre> To find the limit, we need to simplify the expression as x approaches 1.
The first term is 1/(x - 1), which becomes infinite as x approaches 1 since the denominator becomes 0.
The second term is c/(x^3 - 1), which we need to consider more carefully.
As x approaches 1, x^3 - 1 approaches 0, so the second term also becomes undefined.
Therefore, the limit does not exist for any value of c.

A droplet of molten lead of average 1/8 india, at 750°F, falls froma height of 60 ft, and solidifies by the cooling effect of thesurrounding air. The surrounding temperature is 70°F. If thelead solidifies at 621°F, calculate the coefficient of heat transfer. For lead, C_p= 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F \rho= 710lbm/ft^3 h_fusion= 10.6 Btu/lbm

A) 59.2 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
B) 45.7 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
C) 52.8 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
D) 63.4 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the coefficient of heat transfer, we need to use the formula:

$Q = h * A * ΔT$,

where Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the coefficient of heat transfer, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

We are given the following information:

* mass of lead: 1/8 lb;
* height of fall: 60 ft;
* initial temperature of lead: 750°F;
* final temperature of lead: 621°F;
* surrounding temperature: 70°F.

First, we need to determine the change in temperature (ΔT):

ΔT = final temperature - initial temperature = 750°F - 621°F = 129°F.

Next, we need to calculate the heat transfer rate (Q). We can use the equation:

Q = m * Cp * ΔT,

where m is the mass of lead, Cp is the specific heat capacity of lead, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Substituting the given values, we get:

Q = (1/8) lb * 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F * 129°F = 5.24 Btu.

Now, we can calculate the coefficient of heat transfer (h):

h = Q / (A * ΔT),

where A is the surface area of the lead droplet. We do not have the value for A, so we cannot calculate the exact coefficient of heat transfer.

However, we can conclude that the coefficient of heat transfer is likely to be relatively low, as the heat transfer rate is small compared to the mass and temperature difference of the lead.

F) 0.0245
G) 0.0101
H) 0.0213
I) 0.0125
J) 0.0226 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find $P\left(X_1=3, X_2=5\right)$, we can use the hint that this event can occur if and only if $\left\{X_1=1, X_2=0\right\}$ or $\left\{X_1=0, X_2=1\right\}$.

Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent Poisson random variables, the probability of each of these events can be calculated separately.

The probability of $\left\{X_1=1, X_2=0\right\}$ is given by $P(X_1=1) * P(X_2=0) = e^{-2} * 2^1 / 1! * e^{-3} * 3^0 / 0! = 0.084$.

The probability of $\left\{X_1=0, X_2=1\right\}$ is given by $P(X_1=0) * P(X_2=1) = e^{-2} * 0^1 / 1! * e^{-3} * 3^1 / 1! = 0.125$.

Therefore, the total probability of $P\left(X_1=3, X_2=5\right)$ is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $0.084 + 0.125 = 0.209$.

I) - 22,080 cal
J) - 17,500 cal </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the standard heat of reaction at a temperature of 500°C, we need to use the equation for the temperature dependence of the enthalpy change.

The temperature dependence of the enthalpy change can be expressed as:

ΔH(T) = ΔH(25°C) + α * (T - 25°C)

Where ΔH(T) is the enthalpy change at temperature T, ΔH(25°C) is the enthalpy change at 25°C, α is the temperature coefficient, and T is the temperature in degrees Celsius.

We are given the value of ΔH(25°C) as -22.08 kcal.

Let's calculate the enthalpy change at 500°C using the given data:

ΔH(500°C) = -22.08 kcal + α * (500°C - 25°C)

However, the temperature coefficient α is not given in the question. Without the temperature coefficient, we cannot calculate the exact value of ΔH(500°C).

Therefore, we cannot determine the standard heat for the reaction at a temperature of 500°C based on the given information.

###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to find the general solution to the recurrence relation and then use the given initial conditions to determine the particular solution.

The recurrence relation is y[n] - (5/6)y[n - 1] + (1/6)y[n - 2] = 3^n.

We can rewrite this as a characteristic equation by setting the expression equal to a constant value, say C:

C - (5/6)C + (1/6)C = 3^n
(1 - 5/6 + 1/6)C = 3^n
(2/6)C = 3^n
(1/3)C = 3^n

Now, we can find the general solution by solving for C. Since we are looking for the steady-state and homogeneous solutions, we will focus on the homogeneous part of the solution.

The general solution can be written as a linear combination of the roots of the characteristic equation:

y[n] = c1 * r^n + c2 * s^n, where r and s are the roots of the characteristic equation.

In this case, the roots are complex numbers, so we will not be able to find a closed-form solution for y[n]. However, we can use the initial conditions to determine the particular solution.

Given that y[-1] = y[-2] = 0, we can set up a system of equations to solve for c1 and c2.

<pre> Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCDEFGHIJ. Think step by step before answering.

A wife was unhappily married to her husband, an alcoholic. When the husband got drunk, he would become abusive and beat the wife. During the course of their marriage, the beatings became more violent and more frequent. Unable to endure the physical abuse any longer, the wife hired a hit man to kill her husband. One night while the husband was asleep, the hit man entered the home with a key given to him by the wife and shot the husband to death. Afterward, the wife was prosecuted for murder as an accomplice. At trial, the prosecution presented the facts outlined above. Thereafter, the defense sought to have the judge instruct the jury that the wife acted in self- defense under the battered women's syndrome. Based on the given facts, should the judge give such an instruction to the jury?

A) Yes, because, on these facts, a reasonable jury could conclude that the wife acted in self- defense by using necessary force to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.
B) Yes, because the wife was suffering from a psychological condition, battered women's syndrome, which justifies her actions.
C) No, because the wife had the opportunity to leave the house but instead chose to kill her husband.
D) Yes, because the wife had no other means to protect herself from the husband's constant violent attacks.
E) No, because even though the wife was the victim of spousal abuse, she could have avoided the danger by safely retreating.
F) Yes, because the wife was acting under duress due to constant physical abuse.
G) No, because the wife's belief in the necessity of deadly force in self-defense was unreasonable.
H) Yes, because a criminal defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial prohibits a court from refusing to submit affirmative defenses to the jury. </pre>

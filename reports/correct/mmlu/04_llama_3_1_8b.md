based upon rewardor punishment or based upon a need to know. Distinguish on a more specific plane between the three kinds ofresponses to social influence.

A) Conformity, association, and adaptation
B) Agreement, alliance, and absorption
C) Compliance, identification, and internalization
D) Submission, emulation, and inculcation
E) Adherence, affiliation, and incorporation
F) Cooperation, imitation, and assimilation
G) Obedience, integration, and acculturation
H) Respect, imitation, and socialization
I) Acquiescence, imitation, and enculturation
J) Coordination, assimilation, and conformation </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The three kinds of responses to social influence are compliance, identification, and internalization. Compliance is when an individual changes their behavior in response to a reward or punishment. Identification is when an individual changes their behavior in order to be like another person. Internalization is when an individual changes their behavior because they have accepted the values or attitudes of another person. Therefore, the correct answer is C.

In Japan, the frequency of the R-governed multiple drug-resistant strain ofShigella, which causes dysentery, rose from 0.2 percent in 1953 to 58 percent in 1965. Also, 84 percent of the E. coli and 90 percent of Proteus collected from affected hospital patients showed similar resistance. How could such an increase happen?

A) The bacteria developed immunity to antibiotics
B) The bacteria were genetically modified
C) Transfer of resistance genes from non-pathogenic to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene transfer
D) A decline in vaccination rates leading to increased bacterial spread
E) Over-prescription of antibiotics in livestock agriculture leading to cross-species transfer of resistance
F) Natural selection favored bacteria that were inherently resistant to antibiotics
G) The bacteria mutated rapidly
H) Increased use of antibacterial soaps and disinfectants in hospitals
I) Introduction of new antibiotics that were less effective against resistant strains
J) Indiscriminate use of antibiotics selected for drug-resistant bacteria which can then pass their resistance to potentially harmful strains. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's consider the given information and the possible explanations for the increase in the frequency of the R-governed multiple drug-resistant strain of Shigella.

The key points are:

1. The frequency of the R-governed multiple drug-resistant strain of Shigella increased significantly from 0.2% in 1953 to 58% in 1965.
2. A high percentage of E. coli and Proteus collected from affected hospital patients showed similar resistance.

Given these points, we can rule out some options:

- A) The bacteria developed immunity to antibiotics: This is not a scientifically accurate term, as bacteria do not develop immunity like humans do.
- B) The bacteria were genetically modified: There is no indication that genetic modification occurred.
- D) A decline in vaccination rates leading to increased bacterial spread: Vaccination rates are not mentioned in the context of this question.
- F) Natural selection favored bacteria that were inherently resistant to antibiotics: While natural selection does play a role, the question suggests a more rapid increase in resistance, which is not typically seen with inherent resistance.
- G) The bacteria mutated rapidly: While mutations can occur, the question suggests a transfer of resistance rather than a rapid mutation.
- H) Increased use of antibacterial soaps and disinfectants in hospitals: This is not directly related to the increase in resistance.
- I) Introduction of new antibiotics that were less effective against resistant strains: This is not mentioned in the context of the question.

This leaves us with options C, E, and J, which all involve the transfer of resistance genes. However, the question specifically mentions the R-governed multiple drug-resistant strain of Shigella, which suggests a transfer of resistance genes from other bacteria.

Considering the context, the most likely explanation is that the transfer of resistance genes from non-pathogenic to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene transfer (option C) occurred. This is a common mechanism by which bacteria can acquire resistance to antibiotics.

However, the question also mentions the high percentage of E. coli and Proteus showing similar resistance, which suggests that the transfer of resistance genes may have occurred between different species of bacteria.

Given the information and the context, the most comprehensive answer would be option J, which mentions the indiscriminate use of antibiotics selecting for drug-resistant bacteria, which can then pass their resistance to potentially harmful strains. This option encompasses the idea of horizontal gene transfer and the rapid increase in resistance.

Suppose you discovered a new species of bioluminescent worm . How could you prove that it was the worm itself and not some contaminating bacteria that was producing the light ?

A) Place the worm in a dark environment
B) Measure the light intensity emitted by the worm over time
C) Feed the worm with different food sources
D) Place the light-producing substance in complete growth media or physically examine it under a microscope
E) Perform a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance
F) Expose the worm to high temperatures </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To prove that the light is produced by the worm itself and not by contaminating bacteria, we need to rule out the possibility of bacterial contamination. Bacteria are often found in environments where bioluminescent organisms are discovered, and they can produce light. 

Option A, placing the worm in a dark environment, would not help to determine if the light is produced by the worm or bacteria, as bacteria can still produce light in the dark. Option B, measuring the light intensity over time, would also not help to determine the source of the light. Option C, feeding the worm with different food sources, might affect the worm's behavior or physiology but would not directly address the question of whether the light is produced by the worm or bacteria. Option F, exposing the worm to high temperatures, could potentially harm the worm and might not be a reliable method to determine the source of the light.

Option D, placing the light-producing substance in complete growth media or physically examining it under a microscope, would be a good approach to determine if the light is produced by the worm or bacteria. If the light-producing substance is isolated and grown in a controlled environment, and it still produces light, it would suggest that the light is produced by the worm itself. If, on the other hand, the light-producing substance is not isolated and is found to be a bacterial culture, it would indicate that the light is produced by bacteria.

Option E, performing a chemical analysis of the light-producing substance, could also be a good approach, but it would require additional information about the chemical composition of the light produced by the worm and the bacteria.

However, between options D and E, option D is a more direct and straightforward approach to determine if the light is produced by the worm or bacteria.

Blood flows from the right ventricle of the heart into which of the following structures?

A) Coronary arteries
B) Inferior vena cava
C) Pulmonary capillaries
D) Right atrium
E) Left atrium
F) Superior vena cava
G) Aorta
H) Left ventricle
I) Pulmonary veins
J) Pulmonary arteries </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, we need to recall the basic anatomy of the heart and its blood flow.

The right ventricle is one of the four chambers of the heart, and it is responsible for pumping blood to the lungs to be oxygenated. The blood that flows from the right ventricle is deoxygenated, meaning it has not yet picked up oxygen from the lungs.

The correct answer must be a structure that receives deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle. The pulmonary arteries are the vessels that carry deoxygenated blood from the right ventricle to the lungs, where it will pick up oxygen.

So, the correct answer is J) Pulmonary arteries.

Why are slight differences in growth rate percentages so important?

A) They signify shifts in currency exchange rates
B) They are indicative of immediate changes in consumer confidence
C) They determine the exact size of the workforce
D) They indicate economic stability
E) They show population change
F) They indicate the rate of technological innovation
G) They can reflect large differences in potential output
H) They represent the country's GDP
I) They are directly correlated with changes in national education levels
J) They measure the precise impact of foreign investment </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The slight differences in growth rate percentages are important because they can reflect large differences in potential output. This is because small differences in growth rates can add up over time, leading to large differences in the potential output of an economy. For example, a 1% difference in growth rates between two countries can lead to a 10% difference in potential output over a decade.

A 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of vaginal irritation and pain with urination for 5 days. Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?

A) Bacterial vaginosis
B) Candidiasis
C) Chlamydia trachomatis infection
D) Escherichia coli infection </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To approach this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient presents with vaginal irritation and pain with urination (dysuria). These symptoms have been present for 5 days.
2. **Recent Medical History**: She was treated for streptococcal pharyngitis two weeks ago with amoxicillin.
3. **Sexual History**: She is sexually active with two partners over the past year and uses condoms for contraception.
4. **Menstrual History**: Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago.
5. **Physical Examination Findings**: The pelvic examination shows erythema (redness) of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4.

Given these details, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) Bacterial vaginosis**: This condition is characterized by a thin, homogeneous, grayish-white discharge with a pH > 4.5. The discharge in this case is described as thick and white, and the pH is 4, which does not align with bacterial vaginosis.

- **B) Candidiasis**: This is a common cause of vaginal infections, especially in sexually active women. It is characterized by a thick, white, cottage cheese-like discharge, which matches the description in the scenario. Candidiasis is also more likely to occur in women who are not using condoms consistently.

- **C) Chlamydia trachomatis infection**: This is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI) that can cause urethritis and cervicitis. However, it is less likely to cause a thick, white discharge. Chlamydia can cause mucopurulent discharge, but it's not typically described as thick and white.

- **D) Escherichia coli infection**: While E. coli can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), which can present with dysuria, the description of a thick, white vaginal discharge does not align with E. coli infection.

Considering the symptoms and physical examination findings, the most likely cause of the patient's condition is **B) Candidiasis**. Candidiasis is a common cause of vaginal infections, especially in sexually active women, and it matches the description of the discharge in the scenario.

Why is it realistic to expect relatively free entry and exit in a monopolistically competitive industry?

A) Long-term contractual obligations for suppliers
B) Intense competition from foreign markets
C) Patents and copyrights that restrict competition
D) Perfectly homogeneous products
E) Significant economies of scale
F) Numerous, small firms with relatively little capital required
G) High barriers to entry
H) High customer loyalty to existing brands
I) Limited market demand
J) Government regulations </pre>
###### answer
<pre> In a monopolistically competitive industry, there are numerous firms producing differentiated products. This means that each firm has some degree of market power, but not enough to be considered a monopoly. The key characteristic of a monopolistically competitive industry is that there are many firms, each producing a slightly different product. This leads to a situation where firms can enter and exit the market relatively easily, as there are no significant barriers to entry and exit.

Let's consider the options:

A) Long-term contractual obligations for suppliers - This would actually be a barrier to entry, not a reason for relatively free entry and exit.

B) Intense competition from foreign markets - This could actually increase barriers to entry, as firms would face competition from abroad.

C) Patents and copyrights that restrict competition - This would actually reduce competition, not increase it.

D) Perfectly homogeneous products - This is actually a characteristic of perfect competition, not monopolistic competition.

E) Significant economies of scale - This would actually increase barriers to entry, as firms would need to be large to compete.

F) Numerous, small firms with relatively little capital required - This is a key characteristic of monopolistic competition, as it allows for relatively free entry and exit.

G) High barriers to entry - This is the opposite of what we're looking for.

H) High customer loyalty to existing brands - This could actually increase barriers to entry, as firms would need to compete with established brands.

I) Limited market demand - This could actually increase barriers to entry, as firms would need to compete for a limited market.

J) Government regulations - This could actually increase barriers to entry, as firms would need to comply with regulations.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

### logical_deduction_three_objects/2
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost

<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The blue book is the rightmost: `(right) ? blue ? ? ? (left)`.
(2) The orange book is the leftmost: `(right) ? ? ? orange (left)`.
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: `? blue ? ? orange ? (red)`.

According to this ordering, the second from the left book is the orange book.
The orange book is the second from the left. So the answer is (B). </pre>

<pre> Select the humorous edit that 'ruins' the input movie or musical artist name.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'die another day'?
Options:
(A) die anothpr day
(B) diet another day
(C) dies another day
(D) die another ay </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The original name is "die another day". This is the title of the James Bond film.

(A) "die anothpr day": Here the word "another" is shortened to "anothpr", but it doesnâ€™t make sense in context.
(B) "diet another day": Here the word "die" is replaced with "diet", which changes the meaning significantly.
(C) "dies another day": Here the word "die" is replaced with "dies", which also changes the meaning significantly.
(D) "die another ay": Here the word "day" is changed to "ay", but "ay" is not an actual word.

Above the above, none of these options are humorous edits of the original name. Therefore, there is no correct answer for this question. </pre>

The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are five books: a green book, a blue book, a brown book, a gray book, and a red book. The green book is to the left of the brown book. The gray book is to the left of the blue book. The green book is to the right of the blue book. The red book is the leftmost.
Options:
(A) The green book is the second from the left
(B) The blue book is the second from the left
(C) The brown book is the second from the left
(D) The gray book is the second from the left
(E) The red book is the second from the left </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct order of the books on the shelf based on the given descriptions, letâ€™s analyze each paragraph step-by-step:

### Paragraph 1:
**Statements:**
1. The green book is to the left of the brown book.
2. The gray book is to the left of the blue book.
3. The green book is to the right of the blue book.
4. The red book is the leftmost.

**Order Analysis:**
- **Step 1:** We know that the green book is to the left of the brown book. This means the position of these two books relative to each other is certain.
- **Step 2:** The gray book is to the left of the blue book. Again, their positions are fixed relative to each other.
- **Step 3:** The green book is to the right of the blue book. Since the green book cannot be both to the left and to the right of the same object simultaneously, it must mean that the green book is sandwiched between the blue and brown books.
- **Final Order:** `(green)(blue)(brown)(gray)(red)`

Thus, the correct answer for this paragraph is:
- **Green book is the second from the left.**

So the answer is (B): **The blue book is the second from the left.**

---

### Paragraph 2:
**Statements:**
1. The green book is to the left of the brown book.
2. The gray book is to the left of the blue book.
3. The green book is to the right of the blue book.
4. The red book is not the leftmost.

**Order Analysis:**
- **Step 1:** As before, the green book is to the left of the brown book.
- **Step 2:** The gray book is to the left of the blue book.
- **Step 3:** The green book is to the right of the blue book.
- **Step 4:** The red book is not the leftmost.

Since the red book is not the leftmost, it must be somewhere else in the sequence. Given the constraints, the only possible place where the red book can fit without violating any rules is after the green book but before the blue book.

Therefore, the final order is: `(green)(red)(blue)(brown)(gray)`.

Thus, the correct answer for this paragraph is:
- **Red book is the second from the left.**

So the answer is (E): **The red book is the second from the left.** </pre>

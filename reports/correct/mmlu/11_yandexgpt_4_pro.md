###### answer
<pre> First, let's calculate the moles of Na₂SO₄ produced from 1 mole of sulfur.
From the balanced equations, we can see that for every 1 mole of S, we get 1 mole of SO₂, then 2 moles of SO₃, and finally 1 mole of H₂SO₄.
So, from 1 mole of S, we will have 1 mole of H₂SO₄, which reacts with 2 moles of NaOH to produce 1 mole of Na₂SO₄. Therefore, 1 mole of S produces 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.
Now, let's consider the second part of the question: how many moles are possible with 4.5 g of water?
We need to find out how much water is used in the reaction. From the third equation, we see that 1 mole of SO₃ reacts with 1 mole of water to produce H₂SO₄. So, if we start with 4.5 grams of water, we need to convert it to moles. The molar mass of water (H₂O) is 18 g/mol.
4.5g / 18g/mol = 0.25 moles of water
Since 1 mole of SO₃ reacts with 1 mole of water, the maximum amount of Na₂SO₄ that can be produced is also 0.25 moles, as each mole of water will produce 1 mole of H₂SO₄ which will react with 2 moles of NaOH to give 1 mole of Na₂SO₄.
Therefore, the correct answer is D. 1 mole of Na₂SO₄, 0.25 moles of Na₂SO₄

 Which of the following potentially morally relevant differences between Fred's behavior and the behavior of the consumers of factory-raised meat does Norcross not discuss?

In Japan, the frequency of the R-governed multiple drug-resistant strain ofShigella, which causes dysentery, rose from 0.2 percent in 1953 to 58 percent in 1965. Also, 84 percent of the E. coli and 90 percent of Proteus collected from affected hospital patients showed similar resistance. How could such an increase happen?

A) The bacteria developed immunity to antibiotics
B) The bacteria were genetically modified
C) Transfer of resistance genes from non-pathogenic to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene transfer
D) A decline in vaccination rates leading to increased bacterial spread
E) Over-prescription of antibiotics in livestock agriculture leading to cross-species transfer of resistance
F) Natural selection favored bacteria that were inherently resistant to antibiotics
G) The bacteria mutated rapidly
H) Increased use of antibacterial soaps and disinfectants in hospitals
I) Introduction of new antibiotics that were less effective against resistant strains
J) Indiscriminate use of antibiotics selected for drug-resistant bacteria which can then pass their resistance to potentially harmful strains. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> C, J, F, and J are the most plausible explanations for the increase in drug-resistant strains.

C) Transfer of resistance genes from non-pathogenic to pathogenic bacteria through horizontal gene transfer — this mechanism allows for rapid spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria.
J) Indiscriminate use of antibiotics selected for drug-resistant bacteria which can then pass their resistance to potentially harmful strains — overuse of antibiotics promotes the selection and spread of resistant bacteria.
F) Natural selection favored bacteria that were inherently resistant to antibiotics — antibiotic pressure leads to the survival and proliferation of naturally resistant bacterial strains.

The other options are less likely to explain the observed increase:
A) The bacteria developed immunity to antibiotics — bacteria do not develop immunity in the same way as humans or other complex organisms.
B) The bacteria were genetically modified — while genetic modification is possible, it is not the primary explanation for this scenario.
D) A decline in vaccination rates leading to increased bacterial spread — vaccination does not play a role in controlling bacterial infections.
E) Over-prescription of antibiotics in livestock agriculture leading to cross-species transfer of resistance — while important, this factor alone does not fully explain the rise in resistance within human pathogens.
G) The bacteria mutated rapidly — mutations alone cannot account for such a rapid increase in resistance.
H) Increased use of antibacterial soaps and disinfectants in hospitals — these products do not directly select for antibiotic resistance.
I) Introduction of new antibiotics that were less effective against resistant strains — if anything, the introduction of new antibiotics would likely have been in response to increasing resistance, not a cause of it.

Each story of a building is 14.3 feet tall. If the height of the building is 185.9 feet, how many floors does the building have?

A) 10
B) 15
C) 17
D) 9
E) 11
F) 16
G) 12
H) 13
I) 18
J) 14 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the number of floors, we need to divide the total height of the building by the height of each story.
The height of the building is 185.9 feet, and each story is 14.3 feet tall.
So, the number of stories can be found by dividing 185.9 by 14.3:
$\frac{185.9}{14.3}$ = 13
Therefore, the building has 13 floors.

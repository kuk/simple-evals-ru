We should process each input one by one and keep track of the stack configuration.

0: empty stack
1: { ; stack: {
2: ( ; stack: { (
3: { ; stack: { ( {
4: { ; stack: { ( { {
5: &lt; ; stack: { ( { { &lt;

22: ] ; stack: empty
23: > ; stack: empty
24: > ; stack: empty
25: } ; stack: empty

Now, we have reached the end. The final stack is empty.
We will need to pop out the elements one by one in the reverse order of the stack configuration.

So, we need to pop out the following elements:
- 2 closing brackets: ] ]
- 2 closing parentheses: ) )
- 2 closing angle brackets: > >
- 4 closing curly brackets: } }

So the answer is ] ) > > } }. </pre>

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/248
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are seven birds: a quail, a raven, a hummingbird, a robin, a falcon, an owl, and a blue jay. The blue jay is to the left of the falcon. The blue jay is the second from the right. The raven is to the left of the robin. The owl is the third from the right. The hummingbird is to the left of the quail. The raven is the third from the left.
Options:
(A) The quail is the third from the right
(B) The raven is the third from the right
(C) The hummingbird is the third from the right
(D) The robin is the third from the right
(E) The falcon is the third from the right
(F) The owl is the third from the right
(G) The blue jay is the third from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The blue jay is to the left of the falcon: "(left)? blue jay? falcon? (right)".
(2) The blue jay is the second from the right: "(left)?? blue jay falcon (right)".
(3) The raven is to the left of the robin: "(left)? raven robin? (right)".
(4) The owl is the third from the right: "(left)??? owl blue jay falcon (right)".
(5) The hummingbird is to the left of the quail: "(left)? hummingbird quail? (right)".
(6) The raven is the third from the left: "(left) raven robin????? (right)".
(7) Combining (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6) we get the following ordering: "(left) raven robin hummingbird quail owl blue jay falcon (right)".
According to this ordering, the third from the right is the blue jay.
The blue jay is the third from the right. So the answer is (G). </pre>

<pre> Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths.

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 31.00,73.00 L 32.00,59.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 49.00,41.00 L 64.00,37.00 L 71.00,55.00 L 64.00,76.00 L 52.00,61.00 L 31.00,73.00"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 14.19,26.04 L 51.43,39.21 L 58.44,36.69 L 56.63,30.17 L 48.53,26.66 L 14.19,26.04"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

Q: This SVG path element &lt;path d="M 58.00,35.00 L 84.00,35.00 A 26.00,26.00 0.00 0,1 32.26,38.67 L 58.00,35.00"/> draws a

###### answer
<pre> To analyze this path, let's break it down:

This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands, as well as an "A" command. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y). A takes the following parameters: Rx, Ry, phi, any flag, and a target x and y position. Rx and Ry are the x and y radii of the ellipse that approximates the curve. The theta is the angle of the closest point of the curve to the current point. "any flag" specifies the type of the line that the ellipse draws (clockwise, counterclockwise, bye).

This path can be decomposed into 4 separate commands.
(1) M 58.00,35.00: Move the current point to 58.00,35.00.
(2) L 84.00,35.00: Create a line from 58.00,35.00 to 84.00,35.00.
(3) A 26.00,26.00 0.00 0,1 32.26,38.67: This is where things get a bit more complicated.
    A is a quadratic Bézier curve where "any flag" is 0, and a smooth curve, setting "0,1," indicates 1 references point is taken from previous points on curve chart and starting at counter clockwise.
    However the statement in binary begins as (1) is used here- computer translates set bits start following from right

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:

(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We know the following: Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg, Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg.

We delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

Now, we need to find the penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. 

The penguins that are more than 5 years old are Louis (7), Vincent (9), and Gwen (8).
The penguins that weigh more than 12 kg are Louis (11), Vincent (11), and Gwen (15).

The penguins that are both more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg are Louis and Vincent.

There are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. So the answer is (B). </pre>

<pre> Let's think step by step.

We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.

(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 6 steps backward: (0, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 8 steps left: (-8, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 3 steps right: (-5, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 7 steps forward: (2, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 3 steps right: (5, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 9 steps right: (14, -6), facing the positive y-axis.
(8) Take 1 step backward: (14, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(9) Take 7 steps left: (7, -7), facing the positive y-axis.

Since (7, -7) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/117
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too? If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove).

Let's analyze the logical relationship:

- The premise (1) tells us that if someone is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, then they are definitely an owner of Bumble and bumble shampoo.

- However, the reverse is not necessarily true. The premise does not state that being an owner of Bumble and bumble shampoo is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Dove soap.

- Therefore, the statement "everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap" cannot be logically deduced from the given premise.

So, the argument is invalid.

### causal_judgement/62

<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, we are told that "If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail." It is also mentioned that "Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays" and that "This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp."

A typical person would consider that the failure of the circuit breaker is a direct result of all four individuals turning on their lamps simultaneously. Since Jim was one of the four people who turned on his lamp at the same time as the others, his action contributed to the four-lamp scenario that caused the breaker to fail.

Therefore, a typical person would conclude that Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was indeed a contributing factor to the circuit breaker failure.

So the answer is Yes. </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Wayne Rooney watched the pitch go by." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step. Wayne Rooney is a well-known English football (soccer) player. The phrase "watched the pitch go by" suggests he was in a position where the pitch appeared to be moving, which could happen if he was on a moving vehicle, such as a bus or a helicopter, looking down at the pitch. This scenario is unusual but not impossible. Therefore, the answer is yes, it is plausible, though in a specific and somewhat uncommon context. </pre>

### disambiguation_qa/242
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Alex told us that they could not meet.
Options:
(A) Alex could not meet
(B) We could not meet
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

In this sentence, the pronoun "they" is the one we need to identify the antecedent for. The possible referents are "Alex" and "us".

1. If "they" refers to "Alex": "Alex told us that Alex could not meet." This is a straightforward interpretation where Alex is the one who cannot meet.

2. If "they" refers to "us": "Alex told us that we could not meet." This interpretation suggests Alex is informing a group (us) that the group cannot meet.

Given the structure of the sentence, "they" is more likely to refer to the subject of the sentence, which is "Alex," because it's more natural for a person to state their own inability to meet rather than to use "they" to refer to the group being addressed.

However, without additional context, there is a slight ambiguity in the use of "they" in this sentence, as it could theoretically refer to either Alex or the group "us".

Therefore, the most accurate answer is (C) Ambiguous, as the sentence does not provide enough information to definitively resolve the antecedent of "they" without making assumptions. </pre>

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are five birds: a falcon, a raven, a cardinal, a hawk, and a crow. The cardinal is the second from the right. The hawk is to the right of the falcon. The raven is the second from the left. The crow is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The falcon is the leftmost
(B) The raven is the leftmost
(C) The cardinal is the leftmost
(D) The hawk is the leftmost
(E) The crow is the leftmost </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The cardinal is the second from the right: "(left) ? ? ? ? cardinal (right)".

(2) The raven is the second from the left: "(left) raven ? ? ? cardinal (right)".

(3) The crow is the rightmost: "(left) raven ? ? ? cardinal crow (right)".

(4) The hawk is to the right of the falcon.

Given the positions of the cardinal and the crow, the sequence looks like this: "(left) raven ? ? falcon/hawk cardinal crow (right)".

Since the hawk is to the right of the falcon, the falcon cannot be the leftmost.

(5) The only way to satisfy all conditions is: 
"(left) raven falcon ? hawk cardinal crow (right)".

Therefore, the raven is the leftmost.

So the answer is (B). </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the argument step by step:

(1) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika.

(2) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha.

(3) Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.

Hypothesis: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.

Now, let's analyze:

- From (2), we know that every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha.

- (3) tells us that to be a close friend of Francine, one must also be a close friend of Shanika.

- (1) states that a close friend of Francine must be a cousin of Samantha, an ancestor of Janice, or a close friend of Shanika.

Given (2), we already know that every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha.

Therefore, the condition of being an ancestor of Janice is not necessary for being a close friend of Francine, as the other conditions (being a cousin of Samantha or a close friend of Shanika) are already sufficient.

So, the Hypothesis that "being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine" does not follow from the premises.

Therefore, the argument is invalid.

(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: NOT (Manuel = half-brother(Chester)).
(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ancestor(Jeremy), then X = NOT (half-brother(Chester)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy: NOT (Manuel = ancestor(Jeremy))?

Let's analyze the relationship between the premises and the hypothesis:

(1) tells us that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester.

(2) tells us that if someone is an ancestor of Jeremy, then that person is not a half-brother of Chester.

The Hypothesis claims that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy.

Given (1), we know Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester.

However, (2) only tells us that being an ancestor of Jeremy excludes being a half-brother of Chester. It does not provide information about whether Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy.

Therefore, the information in (1) and (2) does not directly lead to the conclusion that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy.

So, the argument is invalid.

### disambiguation_qa/18
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case.
Options:
(A) The lawyer needed to understand
(B) The cashier needed to understand
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.

In this sentence, the pronoun "he" could refer to either the lawyer or the cashier. The sentence is structured as "The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because he needed to understand the case."

- If "he" refers to the lawyer: "The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because the lawyer needed to understand the case." This makes logical sense, as it's the lawyer's job to understand the case details.

- If "he" refers to the cashier: "The lawyer looked into illegal accusations against the cashier, because the cashier needed to understand the case." This is less likely, as the cashier's need to understand the case is not the immediate reason for the lawyer's actions.

However, without additional context, it's not definitively clear whether "he" refers to the lawyer or the cashier, as the cashier's understanding could also be a relevant factor in the scenario.

Therefore, the antecedent of "he" in this sentence is ambiguous.

So the answer is (C) Ambiguous. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, we are told that an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address if two people are logged in at the same time. Both Alice and Zoe logged in at 9 am, which triggered the sending of the email.

A typical person would consider that Zoe's action of logging in at the same time as Alice was a necessary part of the sequence of events that led to the email being sent. Therefore, Zoe's action contributed directly to the outcome.

So, a typical person would conclude that Zoe did indeed cause the empty email to be sent.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. A fruit stand sells five fruits: mangoes, kiwis, plums, pears, and watermelons. The kiwis are less expensive than the plums. The pears are the third-most expensive. The kiwis are the second-cheapest. The watermelons are the most expensive.
Options:
(A) The mangoes are the second-most expensive
(B) The kiwis are the second-most expensive
(C) The plums are the second-most expensive
(D) The pears are the second-most expensive
(E) The watermelons are the second-most expensive </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The kiwis are less expensive than the plums: 
"(cheapest) ? kiwis ? plums ? (most expensive)".

(2) The pears are the third-most expensive.

(3) The kiwis are the second-cheapest.

(4) The watermelons are the most expensive.

Given (3), the order of the cheapest to the most expensive, considering kiwis are second-cheapest, is:
"(cheapest) ? ? kiwis ? ? watermelons".

Given (1), plums are more expensive than kiwis.

Given (2), pears are the third-most expensive.

Given (4), watermelons are the most expensive.

We can now start filling in the order:

- Cheapest: ?
- Second-cheapest: kiwis
- Third-cheapest: ?
- Fourth-cheapest: pears (third-most expensive)
- Most expensive: watermelons

Since kiwis are second-cheapest and pears are third-most expensive, the only remaining positions are for mangoes and plums.

Given (1), plums are more expensive than kiwis but less than pears.

So, the order is:

(cheapest) ? kiwis ? plums ? pears ? watermelons.

This leaves mangoes to be the cheapest.

Therefore, the order is:

(cheapest) mangoes ? kiwis ? plums ? pears ? watermelons.

Given this, the second-most expensive fruit is pears.

So the answer is (D).

The pears are the second-most expensive. </pre>

These movies are known for their blend of action, adventure, and often science-fiction or fantasy elements, with notable visual and narrative complexity.

Among the options:

(A) Attack of the Killer Tomatoes! (comedy, horror; 1978) - Not a fit for the action-adventure/sci-fi themes.
(B) Up (animation, adventure, drama; 2009) - While it has an adventurous element, it's more focused on emotional storytelling and not action/sci-fi.
(C) Ernest Rides Again (comedy; 1983) - Comedy, not action-adventure/sci-fi.
(D) White Christmas (musical, comedy; 1954) - Comedy and musical, not action-adventure/sci-fi.

None of the options perfectly match the action-adventure/sci-fi themes of the given movies, but if we consider the closest thematic and genre alignment:

- None of the options directly align with the action-adventure/sci-fi blend of the given movies.

Given the lack of a perfect match, the question seems to lack a suitable choice. However, if we're looking for the least dissimilar in terms of broad genre (adventure, action, or narrative complexity), none of the options are a clear fit.

Therefore, the best we can do is to note that none of the options (A-D) closely resemble the given movies in terms of genre and thematic content. </pre>

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'batman begins'?
Options:
(A) barman begins
(B) batman bewins
(C) hatman begins
(D) batman begin </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

The original name is "Batman Begins", a movie title.
(A) "barman begins": This changes "batman" to "barman", which humorously suggests a bartender instead of a superhero, making it a humorous edit.
(B) "batman bewins": This changes "begins" to "bewins", which doesn't create a meaningful or humorous change.
(C) "hatman begins": This changes "batman" to "hatman", which is a nonsensical change and not particularly humorous.
(D) "batman begin": This removes the 's' from "begins", making it grammatically incorrect but not humorous.

Among the options, the most humorous edit is (A).

So the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

In this scenario, the hunter's primary intention was to shoot the deer to win the competition. The hunter was aware that shooting the deer would also result in hitting one of the bird-watchers, but his disregard for the bird-watchers' safety indicates that he was willing to accept this outcome. However, his main goal was not to shoot the bird-watchers but to kill the deer.

A typical person would likely consider the hunter's intent and awareness of the outcome. While the hunter did foresee and accept the harm to the bird-watchers, his primary intention was to shoot the deer.

Therefore, a typical person might conclude that the hunter did not intentionally shoot the bird-watcher as his primary goal, even though he was aware of the consequence.

So the answer is No. </pre>

Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: oven costume counterpart
A: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "oven": "o" (15). "costume": "c" (3). "counterpart": "c" (3). We now have: (3) ["costume" ? "counterpart"] &lt; (15) "oven". Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "costume": "o" (15). "counterpart": "o" (15). We now have: (15) ["costume" ? "counterpart"]. Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their third letters.
The third letter: "costume": "s" (19). "counterpart": "u" (21). We now have: (19) "costume" &lt; (21) "counterpart". Hence, we have ["costume" &lt; "counterpart"] &lt; "oven". So the answer is costume counterpart oven.

Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: hypochlorite ponderosa phone credulity
A: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "hypochlorite": "h" (8). "ponderosa": "p" (16). "phone": "p" (16). "credulity": "c" (3). We now have: (3) "credulity" &lt; (8) "hypochlorite" &lt; (16) ["ponderosa" ? "phone"]. Now let's sort this subpart ["ponderosa" ? "phone"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "ponderosa": "o" (15). "phone": "h" (8). We now have: (8) "phone" &lt; (15) "ponderosa". Hence, we have "credulity" &lt; "hypochlorite" &lt; ["phone" &lt;"ponderosa"]. So the answer is credulity hypochlorite phone ponderosa.

"aspect"] &lt; (3) "census" &lt; (13) "mugho" &lt; (14) "newt" &lt; (16) "parthia" &lt; (19) "seismography". Now let's sort this subpart ["arson" ? "aspect"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "arson": "r" (18). "aspect": "s" (19). We now have: (18) "arson" &lt; (19) "aspect". Hence, we have ["arson" &lt; "aspect"] &lt; "census" &lt; "mugho" &lt; "newt" &lt; "parthia" &lt; "seismography". So the answer is arson aspect census mugho newt parthia seismography.

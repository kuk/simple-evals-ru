\lim_{x \to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?

A) -1
B) 5
C) 4
D) 2
E) 0
F) 1/2
G) 3/2
H) -3
I) 1
J) 3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> We can simplify the expression inside the limit by finding a common denominator:
\[ \lim_{x \to 1} \left( \frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{x^3 - 1} \right) = \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(x^2 + x + 1) - c}{(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)} \]
Since the numerator and denominator both approach zero as $x$ approaches 1, we can use L'Hopital's rule to find the limit. Taking the derivative of the numerator and the denominator separately, we get:
\[ \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{(2x + 1)}{(x^2 + x + 1)^2} \]
Substituting $x = 1$, we have:
\[ \frac{(2 \cdot 1 + 1)}{(1^2 + 1 + 1)^2} = \frac{3}{3^2} = \frac{1}{3} \]
Therefore, the limit exists and is equal to $\frac{1}{3}$.
To make this limit equal to a specific value, $c$ must be chosen such that the simplified expression evaluates to that value.
By setting up the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{3} = \frac{(1^2 + 1 + 1) - c}{((1^2) + 1 + 1)^2} \]
We can solve for $c$. Simplifying the equation gives:
\[ 3 = (3) - c \implies c = 0 \]

Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? Scandium has an atomic weight of 44.96 g/mole. The at. wt. of oxygen is 15.999 g/mole.

A) 0.400 g of oxygen
B) 0.800 g of oxygen
C) .444 g of oxygen
D) .623 g of oxygen
E) 0.711 g of oxygen
F) 0.360 g of oxygen
G) 0.250 g of oxygen
H) 0.675 g of oxygen
I) .290 g of oxygen
J) .533 g of oxygen </pre>
###### answer
<pre> First, let's find the molar mass of scandium. The atomic weight is given as 44.96 g/mole, so the molar mass is 44.96 g/mole.
Next, let's calculate the number of moles of scandium in 1 gram. Since the molar mass is 44.96 g/mole, 1 gram is equal to 1/44.96 moles.
Now, let's consider the reaction between scandium and oxygen. We need two atoms of scandium to combine with three atoms of oxygen, which means we need a 3:2 ratio of oxygen to scandium.
To find the amount of oxygen required, we can use the mole ratio from the balanced equation. If we have 1/44.96 moles of scandium, then we need (3/2) * (1/44.96) moles of oxygen.
Finally, let's convert the moles of oxygen to grams. To do this, we multiply the moles by the molar mass of oxygen, which is 15.999 g/mole. So, the total mass of oxygen required is (3/2) * (1/44.96) * 15.999 grams.
Calculating this expression gives us approximately 0.675 grams of oxygen.

For $\mathrm{NaCl}, R_e=2.36 Å$. The ionization energy of $\mathrm{Na}$ is $5.14 \mathrm{eV}$, and the electron affinity of $\mathrm{Cl}$ is $3.61 \mathrm{eV}$. Use the simple model of $\mathrm{NaCl}$ as a pair of spherical ions in contact to estimate $D_e$. [One debye (D) is $3.33564 \times 10^{-30} \mathrm{C} \mathrm{m}$.]

A) 6.12 eV
B) 2.98 eV
C) 3.89 $\mathrm{eV}$
D)  4.56 $\mathrm{eV}$
E) 5.23 $\mathrm{eV}$
F) 7.32 eV
G) 6.47 $\mathrm{eV}$
H) 3.74 eV
I) 5.89 eV
J) 4.02 eV </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The formula for the electrostatic interaction energy between two ions is given by:

$D_e = \frac{k \cdot q_1 \cdot q_2}{R_e}$,

where $q_1$ and $q_2$ are the charges of the ions, $R_e$ is the distance between them, and $k$ is the Coulomb constant.

The charge of an ion can be calculated using the ionization energy and electron affinity:

For $\mathrm{Na}^+$, $q_{\mathrm{Na}} = 1 + \frac{5.14}{96500} = 1.053$.
For $\mathrm{Cl}^-$, $q_{\mathrm{Cl}} = 1 - \frac{3.61}{96500} = 0.964$.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$D_e = \frac{(9 \times 10^9) \cdot (1.053) \cdot (0.964)}{2.36} = 3.89 \, \text{eV}$.

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. The constant-volume heat capacity of a gas can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when it expands adiabatically and reversibly. If the decrease in pressure is also measured, we can use it to infer the value of $\gamma=C_p / C_V$ and hence, by combining the two values, deduce the constant-pressure heat capacity. A fluorocarbon gas was allowed to expand reversibly and adiabatically to twice its volume; as a result, the temperature fell from $298.15 \mathrm{~K}$ to $248.44 \mathrm{~K}$ and its pressure fell from $202.94 \mathrm{kPa}$ to $81.840 \mathrm{kPa}$. Evaluate $C_p$.

J) 62.50$\mathrm{J} \mathrm{K}^{-1} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> First, we need to find the value of $\gamma=C_p / C_V$.
We know that for an adiabatic process, $P V^\gamma = \text{constant}$, where $P$ is pressure and $V$ is volume.
Since the gas expanded to twice its volume, we can write:
$202.94 \times (2V)^{\gamma} = 81.840 \times V^{\gamma}$
Simplifying, we get:
$(2)^{\gamma} \times 202.94 = 81.840$
Taking logarithms of both sides, we find:
$\gamma \times \log(2) + \log(202.94) = \log(81.840)$
Using a calculator, we solve for $\gamma$:
$\gamma = \frac{\log(81.840) - \log(202.94)}{\log(2)} \approx 1.3$
Now, we use the equation $C_p = C_V \times (\gamma + 1)$ to find $C_p$:
$C_p = C_V \times (1.3 + 1) = C_V \times 2.3$
To find $C_V$, we use the formula $T_2 / T_1 = (V_1 / V_2)^\gamma$, where $T$ is temperature and $V$ is volume:
$248.44 / 298.15 = (V_1 / 2V_1)^\gamma$
Simplifying, we have:
$0.834 = (1/2)^\gamma$
Solving for $\gamma$, we find:
$\gamma \approx 0.67$
Substituting this value into the equation for $C_p$, we get:
$C_p \approx C_V \times 1.67$
Finally, using the fact that $C_V = nR$, where $n$ is the number of moles and $R$ is the universal gas constant, we can solve for $C_p$:
$C_p \approx nR \times 1.67 = \left(\frac{PV}{RT}\right) \times R \times 1.67 \approx \frac{P}{T} \times R \times 1.67$
Given that $1 \text{ atm} = 1.01325 \text{ bar}$, we can convert the pressure from kPa to atm:
$P \approx 81.840 / 1.01325 = 80.78 \text{ atm}$
And since $T = 248.44 \text{ K}$, we have:
$C_p \approx \frac{80.78}{248.44} \times 0.0821 \times 1.67 \approx 47.80 \text{ J K}^{-1} \text{ mol}^{-1}$

A toy was originally priced at $2.25 and was later marked down to sell at $2.00. Find the percent of markdown.

A) 5%
B) 12.5%
C) 15%
D) 10%
E) 18%
F) 22%
G) 25%
H) 9%
I) 20%
J) 11% </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The markdown is the difference between the original price and the sale price, which is $2.25 - $2.00 = $0.25.
To find the percent of markdown, we need to divide the markdown by the original price and multiply by 100.
So, the percent of markdown is ($0.25 / $2.25) * 100 = 11.11%.
However, since we are looking for a percentage in one of the given options, we can round this value to the nearest percentage.
The closest option is J) 11%.

### formal_fallacies/123
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: Manuel ≠ half-brother(Chester).
(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ancestor(Jeremy), then X ≠ half-brother(Chester).
Hypothesis: Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy: Manuel ≠ ancestor(Jeremy).

Let's examine whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning:

From (1), we know Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester.
From (2), we understand that being an ancestor of Jeremy means not being a half-brother of Chester. However, this does not directly inform us about Manuel's relationship to Jeremy based on the information given.

The argument attempts to conclude that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy based on the premises. However, the premises do not provide a direct logical link to conclude this. The fact that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester does not necessarily mean he cannot be an ancestor of Jeremy, as the premises do not cover all possible relationships between individuals (e.g., father, grandfather, etc.).

Therefore, the conclusion that "it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy" does not logically follow from the given premises. The argument is trying to make a conclusion about a specific relationship (ancestor) based on information about a different relationship (half-brother), without sufficient logical connection between the two.

So, the answer is: invalid. </pre>

Q: Find a movie similar to Dances with Wolves, The Fugitive, The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart:
Options:
(A) Hostage
(B) Behind Enemy Lines
(C) Get Shorty
(D) Alice </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to Dances with Wolves, The Fugitive, The Shawshank Redemption, and Braveheart, let's first analyze the genres and themes of these movies:

- Dances with Wolves (adventure, drama, western; 1990)
- The Fugitive (action, crime, drama; 1993)
- The Shawshank Redemption (drama; 1994)
- Braveheart (biography, drama, epic; 1995)

These movies are all highly acclaimed, dramatic films with strong narratives, often focusing on themes of freedom, redemption, and the human condition. They are known for their powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and the impact they had on cinema.

Given the options:
(A) Hostage
(B) Behind Enemy Lines
(C) Get Shorty

Among these options, "Behind Enemy Lines" (action, drama, war; 2001) seems to share some common themes with the listed movies, such as action, drama, and a strong narrative drive, although it is more focused on the action and thriller aspects. However, it's the closest match in terms of being an action-drama film compared to the other options provided, which seem to diverge more significantly from the genres and themes of the original list.

Therefore, the answer is (B) Behind Enemy Lines. </pre>

<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition." A typical person would assume that even though the hunter knew the bullet would hit one of the bird-watchers, his primary intention was to shoot and kill the deer to win the competition, not to shoot the bird-watcher. The fact that he didn't care about the bird-watchers suggests a lack of concern, but not necessarily an intention to harm them. Therefore, a typical person would conclude that the hunter did not intentionally shoot the bird-watcher. So the answer is No. </pre>

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Schwechat is a municipality with 19,570 inhabitants southeast of Vienna, on the Schwechat river." 

On the other hand, the provided translation is "Schwechat is a municipality on the dam Schwechat." 

Note that the provided translation contains several errors:
1. The word "dam" is incorrect; it should be "river".
2. The information about the location (southeast of Vienna) and the number of inhabitants (19,570) is missing.

However, the most significant error is that the translation says "dam" instead of "river", and it omits the information about the location and the number of inhabitants. Because a significant clause in the translation was removed, and also a factual error was introduced, we could argue that the translation contains errors pertaining to both Dropped Content and Facts. 

However, the question asks for a single error type. Between the two, the error pertaining to Dropped Content seems more significant because it involves omitting a significant part of the information provided in the source sentence.

So, the answer is (E) Dropped Content. 

Note that another possible answer could be (F) Facts, due to the incorrect translation of "Fluss" as "dam" instead of "river". However, based on the instructions, we should choose one error type, and Dropped Content seems to be the more significant error in this case. </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Pedro struck out the side." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the sentence "Pedro struck out the side" is plausible, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Identify Pedro**: Without a full name, "Pedro" could refer to several individuals across different sports. However, there have been notable athletes named Pedro in baseball, such as Pedro Martinez, a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher.

2. **Understand "struck out the side"**: This phrase is specific to baseball and refers to a pitcher retiring three batters in a row by striking them out. It's a notable achievement that showcases a pitcher's skill and dominance during an inning.

Given that Pedro Martinez is a well-known baseball player, specifically a pitcher, the sentence "Pedro struck out the side" is highly plausible, as it directly aligns with the actions and terminology of the sport he played. Therefore, the answer is yes. </pre>

(E) 07/14/1938
(F) 12/14/1988
A: Let's think step by step.
If today is Christmas Eve of 1937, then today's date is December 24, 1937. 10 days before today is December 14, 1937, that is 12/14/1937. So the answer is (D).

(E) 11/04/2018
A: Let's think step by step.
If tomorrow is 11/12/2019, then today is 11/11/2019. The date one year ago from today is 11/11/2018. So the answer is (B).

(D) 10/14/1960
(E) 01/03/1982
(F) 12/03/1960
A: Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, then and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. The date tomorrow is Jan 3, 1963, that is 01/03/1963. So the answer is (B).

Q: Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958. It is their 5-year anniversary today. What is the date a month ago in MM/DD/YYYY?

(D) 12/02/1960
(E) 05/02/1961
(F) 11/18/1960 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. A month ago would be Dec 2, 1962. So, the correct answer is not listed exactly as calculated, but based on the provided options and the logic applied, the closest match reflecting a date a month prior to January 1963 would indeed relate to December 1962. However, since the exact date of 12/02/1962 is not provided as an option, and given the context that we are looking for a date a month ago from January 2, 1963, the most appropriate choice reflecting a December date (a month before January) would be:

(D) 12/02/1962, which is not listed but would be the correct answer based on our calculation. Since this exact option is not available, and my response must select from the provided choices, I must note that none directly match the calculated answer of 12/02/1962. 

Given the options and the nature of the question, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or a need for clarification in the provided options, as none directly correspond to the calculated date of a month prior to January 2, 1963, which would be December 2, 1962. 

Thus, based on the step-by-step logic but acknowledging the discrepancy with the provided options, the intended answer reflecting a date a month ago from January 2, 1963, would ideally be December 2, 1962, which is not listed. </pre>

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

<pre> Let's think step by step.
The original name is "batman begins". This is the name of a superhero movie.
(A) "barman begins": Here the word "batman" is changed to "barman", and "barman" is an actual word that refers to a person who serves drinks at a bar. This change is indeed a humorous and meaningful edit that ruins the original title of the movie.
(B) "batman bewins": Here the word "begins" is changed to "bewins", but the word "bewins" is not an actual word.
(C) "hatman begins": Here the word "batman" is changed to "hatman", but "hatman" is not as humorous or meaningful as "barman".
(D) "batman begin": Here the word "begins" is changed to "begin", but this change is not humorous, it seems arbitrary.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step:

(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).

Hypothesis: Everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove).

Let's see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the argument (1) by logical reasoning:

The premise (1) states that being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. However, it does not state that being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Dove soap.

In other words, the premise (1) implies that frequent consumers of Dove soap are owners of Bumble and bumble shampoo, but it does not rule out the possibility that there are owners of Bumble and bumble shampoo who are not frequent consumers of Dove soap.

Therefore, we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis from the premise (1). The argument is trying to conclude the converse of the premise, which is not logically equivalent.

So, the answer is: invalid.

This type of fallacy is known as "converse error" or "affirming the converse", where the conclusion is the converse of the premise, but not logically equivalent to it. </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.

(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.

(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

###### answer
<pre> This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).

This path can be decomposed into 7 separate commands.
(1) M 22.00,62.00: Move the current point to 22.00,62.00.
(2) L 46.00,65.00: Create a line from 22.00,62.00 to 46.00,65.00.
(3) L 64.00,60.00: Create a line from 46.00,65.00 to 64.00,60.00.
(4) L 91.00,42.00: Create a line from 64.00,60.00 to 91.00,42.00.
(5) L 92.00,24.00: Create a line from 91.00,42.00 to 92.00,24.00.
(6) L 46.00,19.00: Create a line from 92.00,24.00 to 46.00,19.00.
(7) L 22.00,62.00: Create a line from 46.00,19.00 to 22.00,62.00.

This SVG path starts at point 22.00,62.00, creates six consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a seven-sided shape. "heptagon" is the only seven-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (B). </pre>

### formal_fallacies/39
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine if the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward: If X = brother(Edward), then X = nephew(Henry).
2. Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry: There exists an X such that X = ancestor(Carlos) AND X = workmate(Efrain) AND X = nephew(Henry).
3. Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain: If X = brother(Edward), then X = workmate(Efrain).

Hypothesis: Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward: There exists an X such that X = ancestor(Carlos) AND X = brother(Edward).

From premise 2, we know there exists an X such that X is an ancestor of Carlos, a workmate of Efrain, and a nephew of Henry. 

From premise 1, being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. This means if X is a brother of Edward, then X must be a nephew of Henry. But it does not guarantee that being a nephew of Henry makes X a brother of Edward; there could be other conditions or relationships involved.

Premise 3 tells us that being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. This means if X is a brother of Edward, then X is a workmate of Efrain.

However, the conclusion that somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward is not directly supported by the premises. The premises provide relationships and conditions but do not directly link being an ancestor of Carlos with being a brother of Edward in a way that guarantees the existence of such a person based on the given information.

Given the information and the logical steps provided, the argument seems to be attempting to establish a connection between being an ancestor of Carlos and being a brother of Edward through the shared relationship with Efrain and the condition of being a nephew of Henry. However, the premises do not provide a direct logical link to conclude that there must exist someone who is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the argument appears to be invalid because it does not provide a logically sound basis for concluding that somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward based solely on the given premises. 

The final answer is: invalid </pre>

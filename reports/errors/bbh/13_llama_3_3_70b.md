<pre> Select the humorous edit that 'ruins' the input movie or musical artist name.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'batman begins'?
Options:
(A) barman begins
(B) batman bewins
(C) hatman begins
(D) batman begin </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the humorous edit, let's analyze each option:

(A) "barman begins": This changes "batman" to "barman," which is a playful substitution, as a barman is someone who serves drinks in a bar. This could be seen as humorous because it takes the dark and serious character of Batman and turns him into a figure associated with a more mundane and lighter profession.

(B) "batman bewins": The change from "begins" to "bewins" does not form a recognizable word or phrase that adds humor or meaning to the title.

(C) "hatman begins": Changing "bat" to "hat" doesn't add a clear humorous element or recognizable reference that would "ruin" the title in a comedic way.

(D) "batman begin": This option changes "begins" to "begin," which is a grammatical error rather than a humorous edit. It doesn't add any comedic value or recognizable twist to the title.

Given the analysis, option (A) "barman begins" is the most humorous edit because it replaces "batman" with "barman," creating a unexpected and amusing twist on the original title. 

The answer is (A). </pre>

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step.

(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove)?

Let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. This means that if someone is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, they will necessarily be an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. However, it does not imply that being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is sufficient for being a frequent consumer of Dove soap.

In other words, there might be people who own a Bumble and bumble shampoo without being frequent consumers of Dove soap. The premise only guarantees that frequent consumers of Dove soap will be owners of a Bumble and bumble shampoo, but it does not rule out other possible ways of becoming an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo.

Therefore, the argument is deductively invalid. The conclusion does not logically follow from the premise.

So, the answer is: invalid.

This type of fallacy is known as "affirming the consequent" or "assuming the converse". It occurs when someone assumes that because A implies B, then B must also imply A, which is not necessarily the case. In this example, the premise states that being a frequent consumer of Dove soap implies being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo, but the conclusion incorrectly assumes that being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo implies being a frequent consumer of Dove soap. </pre>

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First premise: Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. Second premise: Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. Third premise: Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. Hence, somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine if the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's break down the premises and the conclusion step by step.

1. **First premise:** Being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward.
   - This can be represented as: If X = brother(Edward), then X = nephew(Henry).

2. **Second premise:** Some ancestor of Carlos is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.
   - This can be represented as: There exists an X such that X = ancestor(Carlos) AND X = workmate(Efrain) AND X = nephew(Henry).

3. **Third premise:** Being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.
   - This can be represented as: If X = brother(Edward), then X = workmate(Efrain).

**Conclusion:** Somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.
- This can be represented as: There exists an X such that X = ancestor(Carlos) AND X = brother(Edward).

Let's analyze the argument:

- From the **first premise**, we know being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward. This implies that if someone is a brother of Edward, they must also be a nephew of Henry.

- The **second premise** tells us there is an ancestor of Carlos who is both a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry. This directly gives us an individual who is a nephew of Henry and also an ancestor of Carlos.

- The **third premise** states that being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain. However, it does not directly link being an ancestor of Carlos with being a brother of Edward.

To deduce the conclusion from the premises, we need to find a logical connection that leads us to the conclusion that somebody is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward.

Given the premises:
- We know from the second premise that there exists an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry.
- From the first premise, being a nephew of Henry is necessary for being a brother of Edward, but it does not guarantee that the ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry is also a brother of Edward.

However, the argument seems to be attempting to use the information about workmates and nephews to bridge the connection. The critical link here is the second premise, which tells us about an ancestor of Carlos who is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry, and the third premise, which connects being a brother of Edward with being a workmate of Efrain.

But, let's carefully examine the logical flow:
- The second premise gives us an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain.
- The first premise tells us that to be a brother of Edward, one must be a nephew of Henry.
- The third premise tells us that being a brother of Edward is sufficient for being a workmate of Efrain.

The argument's conclusion that somebody is an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward seems to rely on the idea that since there's an ancestor of Carlos who is a nephew of Henry and a workmate of Efrain, and given that being a brother of Edward makes one a workmate of Efrain (and requires being a nephew of Henry), we can infer that this ancestor of Carlos is also a brother of Edward because they are a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry.

However, this inference is not strictly logical based on the premises given. The premises provide a connection between being a nephew of Henry and being a brother of Edward, and between being a brother of Edward and being a workmate of Efrain, but they do not directly establish that the ancestor of Carlos who is a workmate of Efrain and a nephew of Henry is therefore a brother of Edward. The connection relies on an assumption that being a workmate of Efrain (as mentioned in the second premise) and being a nephew of Henry (necessary for being a brother of Edward) is sufficient to conclude that this individual is a brother of Edward, which is not directly supported by the premises.

Therefore, the argument is **invalid** because it makes an unjustified leap in concluding that somebody is both an ancestor of Carlos and a brother of Edward based on the given premises. The premises do not provide a direct logical link to support the conclusion without additional assumptions. </pre>

<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.
Options:
(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
(B) The receptionist was in a good mood
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the antecedent of the pronoun "she", let's analyze the sentence step by step. The sentence is of the form "X greets Y because (X or Y) was in a good mood." Let X be the mechanic and Y be the receptionist.

First, consider Y: "X greets Y because Y was in a good mood." This implies that the reason for the greeting is the receptionist's mood, which doesn't necessarily make sense because the greeting is an action initiated by the mechanic. It's more logical that the mechanic's action (greeting) would be influenced by their own mood rather than the receptionist's.

Now, consider X: "X greets Y because X was in a good mood." This case makes more sense because it suggests that the mechanic's mood is the reason for greeting the receptionist. If the mechanic is in a good mood, they might be more inclined to greet the receptionist.

Given this analysis, the most logical interpretation is that the mechanic's mood is the reason for the greeting, making the antecedent of "she" the mechanic. Therefore, the answer is (A) The mechanic was in a good mood. </pre>

Note that the provided sentence says, "Łeba is not a small town ..." However, the translation should have been "Łeba is a small town ..." Because a negation is introduced at the beginning of the sentence and has fundamentally changed the meaning of the original source, the translation contains an error pertaining to Negation or Antonyms. So the answer is (C).

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We solve this question by first translating the source sentence to English and then by comparing our translation with the provided translation. According to Google Translate, the correct translation of the source sentence from German to English is "Schwechat is a town municipality with 19,570 inhabitants southeast of Vienna, on the Schwechat river."

On the other hand, the provided translation is "Schwechat is a municipality on the dam Schwechat." 

Note that the provided translation contains several errors:
1. The original source sentence mentions that Schwechat is a "Stadtgemeinde" which translates to "town municipality", but the translation does not convey this information correctly.
2. The original source sentence mentions the population of Schwechat (19,570 inhabitants), but this information is missing in the translation.
3. The original source sentence mentions the location of Schwechat as "südöstlich von Wien" which translates to "southeast of Vienna", but the translation does not convey this information correctly.
4. The original source sentence mentions that Schwechat is located "am Fluss Schwechat" which translates to "on the Schwechat river", but the translation incorrectly translates it to "on the dam Schwechat".

Because several significant details about Schwechat are missing or incorrect in the translation, the translation contains an error pertaining to Dropped Content and Facts. However, the most significant error is that a significant clause in the translation was removed. So the answer is (E). 

Note: There is also an error in the translation of "am Fluss Schwechat" to "on the dam Schwechat", which could be classified as a factual error. However, the question seems to be looking for the most significant error, which is the removal of significant clauses. 

The best answer is (E). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Scenario**: The hunter's primary goal is to win the competition by killing the deer. He is aware that shooting the deer will also result in hitting one of the bird-watchers due to their position.

2. **Intentionality**: The key to determining if the hunter intentionally shot the bird-watcher lies in understanding what "intentionally" means in this context. Intentionally performing an action means that the person aimed to achieve the outcome of that action.

3. **Hunter's Goal**: The hunter's intention is to kill the deer to win the competition. He is aware that his action (shooting the deer) will have a secondary consequence (hitting a bird-watcher), but his primary goal is not to harm the bird-watchers.

4. **Distinction Between Intent and Knowledge of Consequences**: The hunter knows that shooting the deer will result in hitting a bird-watcher, but his intention is focused on killing the deer, not on harming the bird-watchers. This distinction is crucial in determining the intentionality of his actions towards the bird-watchers.

5. **Conclusion**: Given that the hunter's primary intention is to kill the deer and win the competition, and not specifically to shoot the bird-watcher, a typical person would likely conclude that the hunter did not intentionally shoot the bird-watcher. The harm to the bird-watcher is a known but unintended consequence of his action aimed at achieving a different goal (killing the deer).

So, the answer is **No**. The hunter did not intentionally shoot the bird-watcher; his intention was to kill the deer to win the competition, with the consequence of hitting a bird-watcher being a foreseeable but not primarily intended outcome. </pre>

### formal_fallacies/123
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the argument is deductively valid or invalid, let's analyze the premises and the conclusion step by step.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: Manuel ≠ half-brother(Chester).
(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ancestor(Jeremy), then X ≠ half-brother(Chester).
Hypothesis: Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy: Manuel ≠ ancestor(Jeremy).

From premise (1), we know Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester. 
From premise (2), we understand that being an ancestor of Jeremy means one cannot be a half-brother of Chester. 

However, the fact that Manuel is not a half-brother of Chester (premise 1) does not necessarily mean he is an ancestor of Jeremy, nor does it directly imply he is not an ancestor of Jeremy based on the information given in premise (2). Premise (2) only tells us about the relationship between being an ancestor of Jeremy and being a half-brother of Chester, not about other possible relationships Manuel might have with Jeremy or Chester.

Therefore, we cannot logically deduce from the given premises that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy. The argument attempts to conclude a specific relationship (Manuel not being an ancestor of Jeremy) based on information that does not directly support such a conclusion. Thus, the argument is invalid. 

The answer is: invalid. </pre>

###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to the given list, let's analyze the characteristics of the movies listed:

- Dances with Wolves (adventure, drama, western; 1990)
- The Fugitive (action, crime, drama; 1993)
- The Shawshank Redemption (drama; 1994)
- Braveheart (biography, drama, history; 1995)

These movies are all highly acclaimed, dramatic, and were produced in the 1990s. They often feature themes of survival, redemption, and the struggle against adversity, with some incorporating elements of action and historical context.

Among the options provided:
(A) Hostage (crime, drama, thriller; 2005) - While it's a thriller, it doesn't quite match the epic or historical scope of the listed movies.
(B) Behind Enemy Lines (action, drama, war; 2001) - This movie shares some elements of action and drama but is more focused on war.
(C) Get Shorty (comedy, crime; 1995) - This is a comedy-crime film, which doesn't fit the dramatic and often historical or epic nature of the listed movies.
(D) Alice - Without a specific movie title or year, it's hard to determine its relevance, but assuming it refers to a film like "Alice in Wonderland," it would be quite different from the listed movies in terms of genre and tone.

Given the options, "Behind Enemy Lines" (B) seems to be the closest in terms of action and drama elements, even though it doesn't perfectly match the historical or epic drama genres of the listed films. However, considering the typical characteristics of movies similar to those listed (dramatic, often historical, and with themes of struggle or redemption), none of the provided options perfectly fit. But if we must choose from the given options, (B) Behind Enemy Lines would be the most similar in terms of action and drama, despite its differences.

A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor.

Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Understanding the Setup**: The machine is designed to short circuit only if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery simultaneously. If only one wire touches the battery, there will be no short circuit.

2. **The Role of Each Wire**: The black wire is intended to touch the battery as part of the machine's normal operation, while the red wire is not supposed to touch the battery under normal circumstances.

3. **The Incident**: Both wires end up touching the battery at the same time, resulting in a short circuit.

4. **Causal Attribution**: The question is whether the black wire caused the short circuit. 

Given that the black wire is supposed to touch the battery as part of the machine's normal operation, its action alone (touching the battery) does not lead to a short circuit. The critical factor that leads to the short circuit is the simultaneous touch of both the black and the red wires to the battery. 

However, a typical person might reason that since the black wire's touch is a necessary condition for the short circuit (as the machine is designed for the black wire to touch the battery), and the short circuit occurred when both wires touched the battery, the black wire did play a role in causing the short circuit. But, considering the context that the black wire is supposed to be in contact with the battery as part of normal operation, and it's the red wire's unexpected contact that actually leads to the abnormal condition (short circuit), the attribution of causality might lean towards the red wire as the primary cause of the short circuit, because its action is the deviation from the intended state.

Despite this, the question asks about the black wire's role in causing the short circuit, not whether it was the sole or primary cause. Since the short circuit would not have occurred without the black wire (given that both wires must touch the battery for a short circuit to happen), a typical person might still conclude that the black wire did cause the short circuit, albeit as part of a necessary condition in conjunction with the red wire's action.

So, the answer is: **Yes**. </pre>

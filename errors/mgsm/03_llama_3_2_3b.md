According to its nutritional info, a bag of chips has 250 calories per serving. If a 300g bag has 5 servings, how many grams can you eat if your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find out how many calories are in the 300g bag, we need to multiply the number of calories per serving by the number of servings. 

250 calories/serving * 5 servings = 1250 calories

Since we have already consumed 1800 calories, we need to subtract that from our daily calorie target to find out how many calories we have left. 

2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 calories

Now, we need to divide the remaining calories by the calories per serving to find out how many servings we can have left. 

200 calories / 250 calories/serving = 0.8 servings

Since we know that the 300g bag has 5 servings, we can multiply the number of servings we can have left by the total number of servings in the bag to find out how many grams we can eat. 

0.8 servings * 300g/serving = 240g

Answer: 240 </pre>

On Monday, Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister. On Tuesday, she ate twice as many cookies as her sister. Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday and 13 the next day. If 1 cookie has 200 calories, how many more calories did Sue consume than her sister? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find out how many cookies Sue ate, we need to calculate the number of cookies she ate on Monday and Tuesday.

On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. Since Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.

On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies, and since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister, Sue ate 2 * 13 = 26 cookies.

The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 (Monday) + 26 (Tuesday) = 46 cookies.

The total number of cookies her sister ate is 5 + 13 = 18 cookies.

To find the difference in calorie consumption, we multiply the number of cookies eaten by the calories per cookie, and then subtract the total calories eaten by her sister from the total calories eaten by Sue.

Sue consumed 46 * 200 = 9200 calories, and her sister consumed 18 * 200 = 3600 calories.

The difference between the number of calories consumed by Sue and her sister is 9200 - 3600 = 5600. </pre>

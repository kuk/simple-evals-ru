###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: There exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel while not a niece of Nelda. Nobody is neither a stepsister of Christine nor a niece of Nelda. So, necessarily, there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel and a stepsister of Christine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) There exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel while not a niece of Nelda: ∃X (workmate(Guadalupe, X) AND ancestor(X, Jewel) AND NOT niece(X, Nelda)).

(2) Nobody is neither a stepsister of Christine nor a niece of Nelda: ∀X (stepsister(X, Christine) OR niece(X, Nelda)).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that there exists a workmate of Guadalupe who is an ancestor of Jewel and a stepsister of Christine: ∃X (workmate(Guadalupe, X) AND ancestor(X, Jewel) AND stepsister(X, Christine))?

Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning.

By (1), we know there exists a person X who is a workmate of Guadalupe, an ancestor of Jewel, and not a niece of Nelda.

By (2), we know that for all persons, they are either a stepsister of Christine or a niece of Nelda. Since X is not a niece of Nelda (from (1)), X must be a stepsister of Christine (by (2)).

So, we have: X is a workmate of Guadalupe, an ancestor of Jewel, and a stepsister of Christine. This matches the Hypothesis.

Therefore, the argument is valid. 

The answer is valid. </pre>

Options:
(A) LA Confidential
(B) PS I Love You
(C) Boyz N the Hood
(D) Let It Ride </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find a movie similar to the given list, let's analyze the genres and themes of the listed movies:

- Star Wars Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (action, adventure, fantasy; 1980)
- The Usual Suspects (crime, thriller, mystery; 1995)
- Star Wars Episode IV - A New Hope (action, adventure, fantasy; 1977)
- The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (action, adventure, fantasy; 2003)

These movies are all highly acclaimed, with a focus on action, adventure, and fantasy, except for The Usual Suspects, which is a crime thriller but shares the trait of being highly acclaimed and influential in its genre.

Among the given options:
(A) LA Confidential (crime, drama, mystery; 1997) - While it's a highly acclaimed film, it doesn't match the fantasy/adventure theme prevalent in most of the listed movies.
(B) PS I Love You (drama, romance; 2007) - This is a romantic drama and doesn't fit the action/adventure/fantasy theme.
(C) Boyz N the Hood (crime, drama; 1991) - This is a coming-of-age drama and doesn't fit the action/adventure/fantasy theme.
(D) Let It Ride (comedy, drama; 1989) - This is a comedy-drama and doesn't fit the action/adventure/fantasy theme.

However, considering the influence, acclaim, and the broader appeal of the movies listed, none of the provided options directly match the genres of the majority of the films listed (Star Wars, Lord of the Rings). But if we were to choose based on the criterion of being a highly influential and acclaimed film, which might be the underlying reason for selecting The Usual Suspects alongside the fantasy/adventure films, LA Confidential stands out as a highly acclaimed and influential film in its genre, similar to how The Usual Suspects is in the crime/thriller genre.

So, the answer would be (A) LA Confidential, by the process of elimination and considering the broader context of influence and acclaim. </pre>

(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take 2 steps. Turn right. Take 6 steps. Take 10 steps. Take 7 steps.
Options:
- Yes

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis, but since the first instruction is to take steps without specifying a direction, we'll assume the steps are taken in the direction we're facing, which is the positive y-axis.

(1) Take 2 steps: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Turn right: (0, 2), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (6, 2), facing the positive x-axis.
(4) Take 10 steps: (16, 2), facing the positive x-axis.
(5) Take 7 steps: (23, 2), facing the positive x-axis.

Since (23, 2) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No. </pre>

<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((3 * 8 * -1 * -9) - (-2 + 2 * -8 * 8)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we'll follow the order of operations: parentheses, exponents, multiplication and division (from left to right), and addition and subtraction (from left to right).

This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (3 * 8 * -1 * -9) and B = (-2 + 2 * -8 * 8).

Let's calculate A = (3 * 8 * -1 * -9). 
Following the order of operations for multiplication from left to right:
- First, 3 * 8 = 24
- Then, 24 * -1 = -24
- Finally, -24 * -9 = 216

So, A = 216.

Now, let's calculate B = (-2 + 2 * -8 * 8).
Following the order of operations:
- First, calculate the multiplication from left to right: 2 * -8 = -16
- Then, -16 * 8 = -128
- Finally, -2 + (-128) = -130

So, B = -130.

Then, the final equation is A - B = 216 - (-130) = 216 + 130 = 346.

The answer is 346. </pre>

### multistep_arithmetic_two/180
###### instruction
<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((8 * -6 + -9 + 9) * (0 - 4 - 0 - -9)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> 

To solve this problem, we'll follow the order of operations: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right).

This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (8 * -6 + -9 + 9) and B = (0 - 4 - 0 - -9).

Let's calculate A = (8 * -6 + -9 + 9) = ((8 * -6) + -9 + 9) = (-48 + -9 + 9) = (-48 + (-9 + 9)) = (-48 + 0) = -48.

Let's calculate B = (0 - 4 - 0 - -9) = (0 - 4 - 0 + 9) = ((0 - 4 - 0) + 9) = ((-4) + 9) = (-4 + 9) = 5.

Then, the final equation is A * B = -48 * 5 = -240.

So, the answer is -240. </pre>

### word_sorting/73
###### instruction
<pre> Sort a list of words.

Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: oven costume counterpart
A: Let's think step by step.
The first letter: "oven": "o" (15). "costume": "c" (3). "counterpart": "c" (3). We now have: (3) ["costume" ? "counterpart"] < (15) "oven". Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their second letters.
The second letter: "costume": "o" (15). "counterpart": "o" (15). We now have: (15) ["costume" ? "counterpart"]. Now let's sort this subpart ["costume" ? "counterpart"] by looking at their third letters.
The third letter: "costume": "s" (19). "counterpart": "u" (21). We now have: (19) "costume" < (21) "counterpart". Hence, we have ["costume" < "counterpart"] < "oven". So the answer is costume counterpart oven.

<pre> To sort the given list of words alphabetically, let's break it down step by step:

1. The first letter of each word:
   - "xylem": "x" (24)
   - "neoclassic": "n" (14)
   - "rest": "r" (18)
   - "fortieth": "f" (6)
   - "marshall": "m" (13)
   - "wiley": "w" (23)
   - "convey": "c" (3)
   - "experiment": "e" (5)
   - "whimper": "w" (23)
   - "kudo": "k" (11)
   - "decimate": "d" (4)
   - "incautious": "i" (9)
   - "z's": "z" (26)

2. Sorting based on the first letter:
   - (3) "convey"
   - (4) "decimate"
   - (5) "experiment"
   - (6) "fortieth"
   - (9) "incautious"
   - (11) "kudo"

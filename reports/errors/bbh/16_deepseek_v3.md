###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a yellow book, a brown book, a white book, an orange book, a black book, a blue book, and a purple book. The black book is the second from the left. The white book is to the right of the orange book. The black book is to the right of the brown book. The yellow book is the third from the right. The purple book is the third from the left. The orange book is the second from the right.
Options:
(A) The yellow book is the second from the right
(B) The brown book is the second from the right
(C) The white book is the second from the right
(D) The orange book is the second from the right
(E) The black book is the second from the right
(F) The blue book is the second from the right
(G) The purple book is the second from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The black book is the second from the left: "(left) ? black ? ? ? ? ? (right)".
(2) The white book is to the right of the orange book: "(left) ? ? ? ? orange white ? (right)".
(3) The black book is to the right of the brown book: "(left) brown black ? ? ? ? (right)".
(4) The yellow book is the third from the right: "(left) ? ? ? ? ? yellow ? (right)".
(5) The purple book is the third from the left: "(left) ? ? purple ? ? ? ? (right)".
(6) The orange book is the second from the right: "(left) ? ? ? ? ? orange ? (right)".
(7) Combining (1), (3), and (5) we get the following ordering: "(left) brown black purple ? ? ? ? (right)".
(8) Combining (2) and (6) we get the following ordering: "(left) ? ? ? ? orange white ? (right)".
(9) Combining (4) and (6) we get the following ordering: "(left) ? ? ? ? ? orange yellow (right)".
(10) Combining (7), (8), and (9) we get the following ordering: "(left) brown black purple ? orange white yellow (right)".
(11) The only position left is the fourth from the left, which must be the blue book: "(left) brown black purple blue orange white yellow (right)".
According to this ordering, the second from the right is the white book.
The white book is the second from the right. So the answer is (C). </pre>

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 9 separate commands.
(1) M 31.00,73.00: Move the current point to 31.00,73.00.
(2) L 32.00,59.00: Create a line from 31.00,73.00 to 32.00,59.00.
(3) L 44.00,50.00: Create a line from 32.00,59.00 to 44.00,50.00.
(4) L 49.00,41.00: Create a line from 44.00,50.00 to 49.00,41.00.
(5) L 64.00,37.00: Create a line from 49.00,41.00 to 64.00,37.00.
(6) L 71.00,55.00: Create a line from 64.00,37.00 to 71.00,55.00.
(7) L 64.00,76.00: Create a line from 71.00,55.00 to 64.00,76.00.
(8) L 52.00,61.00: Create a line from 64.00,76.00 to 52.00,61.00.
(9) L 31.00,73.00: Create a line from 52.00,61.00 to 31.00,73.00.
This SVG path starts at point 31.00,73.00, creates eight consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating an eight-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "octagon" is the only eight-sided object on the list. So the answer is (F).

Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 14.19,26.04 L 51.43,39.21 L 58.44,36.69 L 56.63,30.17 L 48.53,26.66 L 14.19,26.04"/> draws a
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 14.19,26.04: Move the current point to 14.19,26.04.
(2) L 51.43,39.21: Create a line from 14.19,26.04 to 51.43,39.21.
(3) L 58.44,36.69: Create a line from 51.43,39.21 to 58.44,36.69.
(4) L 56.63,30.17: Create a line from 58.44,36.69 to 56.63,30.17.
(5) L 48.53,26.66: Create a line from 56.63,30.17 to 48.53,26.66.
(6) L 14.19,26.04: Create a line from 48.53,26.66 to 14.19,26.04.
This SVG path starts at point 14.19,26.04, creates five consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a five-sided shape. It does not have any curves or arches. "pentagon" is the only five-sided polygon on the list. So the answer is (G).

Q: This SVG path element <path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 5 separate commands.
(1) M 41.00,43.00: Move the current point to 41.00,43.00.
(2) L 37.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,43.00 to 37.00,34.00.
(3) L 41.00,33.00: Create a line from 37.00,34.00 to 41.00,33.00.
(4) L 45.00,34.00: Create a line from 41.00,33.00 to 45.00,34.00.
(5) L 41.00,43.00: Create a line from 45.00,34.00 to 41.00,43.00.
This SVG path starts at point 41.00,43.00, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite" and "rectangle" are the only two four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((41.00-37.00)^2 + (43.00-34.00)^2) = sqrt((4)^2 + (9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((37.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-33.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((41.00-45.00)^2 + (33.00-34.00)^2)) = sqrt((-4)^2 + (-1)^2) = sqrt(16 + 1) = sqrt(17).
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((45.00-41.00)^2 + (34.00-43.00)^2)) = sqrt((4)^2 + (-9)^2) = sqrt(16 + 81) = sqrt(97).
Note that |A| = |D| and |B| = |C|. Furthermore, A and D are adjacent and B and C are adjacent. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides and is "kite". So the answer is (D).

(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
(K) trapezoid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
This SVG path element contains "M" and "L" commands. M takes two parameters (x,y) and moves the current point to the coordinates (x,y). L takes two parameters (x,y) and draws a line from the previous coordinate to the new coordinate (x,y).
This path can be decomposed into 6 separate commands.
(1) M 63.87,16.63: Move the current point to 63.87,16.63.
(2) L 66.66,42.93: Create a line from 63.87,16.63 to 66.66,42.93.
(3) L 38.28,45.94: Create a line from 66.66,42.93 to 38.28,45.94.
(4) L 35.49,19.64: Create a line from 38.28,45.94 to 35.49,19.64.
(5) M 35.49,19.64: Move the current point to 35.49,19.64.
(6) L 63.87,16.63: Create a line from 35.49,19.64 to 63.87,16.63.
This SVG path starts at point 63.87,16.63, creates four consecutive and touching lines, and then returns back its starting point, thereby creating a four-sided shape. "kite", "rectangle", and "trapezoid" are the only three four-sided polygons on the list. So, we need to determine which one is the correct answer.
A kite has two pairs of equal-length adjacent sides, whereas a rectangle has two pairs of equal-length alternate (opposite) sides. A trapezoid has at least one pair of parallel sides. Now, let's check whether the two adjacent sides of this shape are equal.
Length of side A: |A| = sqrt((63.87-66.66)^2 + (16.63-42.93)^2) = sqrt((-2.79)^2 + (-26.3)^2) = sqrt(7.7841 + 691.69) = sqrt(699.4741) = 26.447.
Length of side B: |B| = sqrt((66.66-38.28)^2 + (42.93-45.94)^2)) = sqrt((28.38)^2 + (-3.01)^2) = sqrt(805.4244 + 9.0601) = sqrt(814.4845) = 28.539.
Length of side C: |C| = sqrt((38.28-35.49)^2 + (45.94-19.64)^2)) = sqrt((2.79)^2 + (26.3)^2) = sqrt(7.7841 + 691.69) = sqrt(699.4741) = 26.447.
Length of side D: |D| = sqrt((35.49-63.87)^2 + (19.64-16.63)^2)) = sqrt((-28.38)^2 + (3.01)^2) = sqrt(805.4244 + 9.0601) = sqrt(814.4845) = 28.539.
Note that |A| = |C| and |B| = |D|. Furthermore, A and C are alternate (opposite) sides and B and D are alternate (opposite) sides. Thus, this polygon has two pairs of equal-length alternate sides and is "rectangle". So the answer is (H). </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the hunter "does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition." A typical person would assume that the hunter did not intend to shoot the bird-watcher, even though he knew that the bullet would hit one of them. The hunter's primary goal was to kill the deer and win the competition, and the harm to the bird-watcher was a foreseen but unintended consequence. Therefore, the answer is No. </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?

It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the argument (1) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble). However, this does not imply the converse, i.e., if X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove). The argument commits the fallacy of affirming the consequent, which is a formal fallacy. So the answer is invalid. </pre>

Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is 'batman begins'. This is the name of a movie about the superhero Batman.
(A) 'barman begins': This changes 'batman' to 'barman', which refers to a bartender. This is a humorous edit because it replaces the superhero with a completely different profession, creating a funny contrast.
(B) 'batman bewins': This changes 'begins' to 'bewins', which is not a real word and does not make sense. This edit is not humorous because it lacks meaning or cleverness.
(C) 'hatman begins': This changes 'batman' to 'hatman', which is a playful but less impactful edit. While it is somewhat humorous, it does not 'ruin' the original name as effectively as (A).
(D) 'batman begin': This removes the 's' from 'begins', making it grammatically incorrect. This edit is not humorous because it is simply a typo and does not add any cleverness or wit.
Among the options, (A) 'barman begins' is the most humorous edit because it creatively replaces the superhero with a bartender, creating a funny and unexpected twist. So the answer is (A). </pre>

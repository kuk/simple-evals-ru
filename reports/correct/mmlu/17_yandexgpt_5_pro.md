Each story of a building is 14.3 feet tall. If the height of the building is 185.9 feet, how many floors does the building have?

A) 13
B) 18
C) 15
D) 16
E) 9
F) 11
G) 17
H) 10
I) 14
J) 12 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the number of floors in the building, we need to divide the total height of the building by the height of each floor.

The height of each floor is given as 14.3 feet, and the total height of the building is 185.9 feet.

We perform the division:
\[ \frac{185.9}{14.3} \]

First, we calculate the quotient:
\[ 185.9 \div 14.3 \approx 13 \]

Since the result is exactly 13, the building has 13 floors.

H) 390 $\mathrm{~K}$
I)  432 $\mathrm{~K}$
J) 550 $\mathrm{~K}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we use the Boltzmann distribution, which describes the distribution of particles over different energy states at a given temperature. The ratio of the population in the first excited state to the ground state is given by:

\[ \frac{N_1}{N_0} = e^{-\frac{E_1 - E_0}{kT}} \]

where:
- \( N_1 \) is the population in the first excited state,
- \( N_0 \) is the population in the ground state,
- \( E_1 \) is the energy of the first excited state,
- \( E_0 \) is the energy of the ground state,
- \( k \) is the Boltzmann constant (\( 1.38 \times 10^{-23} \, \text{J/K} \)),
- \( T \) is the temperature in Kelvin.

Given that the population in the first excited state is half that of the ground state, we have:

\[ \frac{N_1}{N_0} = \frac{1}{2} \]

The energy difference between the first excited state and the ground state is related to the vibrational frequency \( \nu \) by:

\[ E_1 - E_0 = h \nu \]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant (\( 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \, \text{JÂ·s} \)) and \( \nu \) is the vibrational frequency in \( \text{cm}^{-1} \). The frequency \( \nu \) is given as \( 208 \, \text{cm}^{-1} \). To convert this to Hertz, we use the relation:

\[ \nu_{\text{Hz}} = \nu_{\text{cm}^{-1}} \times c \]

where \( c \) is the speed of light in \( \text{cm/s} \) (\( 3 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/s} \)).

Thus,

\[ \nu_{\text{Hz}} = 208 \times 3 \times 10^{10} = 6.24 \times 10^{12} \, \text{Hz} \]

Now, we can calculate the energy difference:

\[ E_1 - E_0 = h \nu_{\text{Hz}} = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \times 6.24 \times 10^{12} = 4.13 \times 10^{-21} \, \text{J} \]

Substituting this into the Boltzmann distribution equation:

\[ \frac{1}{2} = e^{-\frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} T}} \]

Taking the natural logarithm of both sides:

\[ \ln \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) = -\frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} T} \]

\[ -\ln(2) = -\frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} T} \]

\[ \ln(2) = \frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} T} \]

\[ T = \frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \ln(2)} \]

\[ T = \frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{1.38 \times 10^{-23} \times 0.693} \]

\[ T = \frac{4.13 \times 10^{-21}}{0.955 \times 10^{-23}} \]

\[ T = \frac{4.13}{0.955} \times 10^2 \]

\[ T \approx 4.32 \times 10^2 \, \text{K} \]

\[ T \approx 432 \, \text{K} \]

J) 0.0101 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve the problem, we need to find the probability \( P(X_1 = 3, X_2 = 5) \) for independent Poisson random variables \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) with means \( \lambda_1 = 2 \) and \( \lambda_2 = 3 \), respectively.

The probability mass function of a Poisson random variable \( X \) with mean \( \lambda \) is given by:
\[ P(X = k) = \frac{e^{-\lambda} \lambda^k}{k!} \]

First, we calculate \( P(X_1 = 3) \):
\[ P(X_1 = 3) = \frac{e^{-2} 2^3}{3!} = \frac{e^{-2} \cdot 8}{6} = \frac{4e^{-2}}{3} \]

Next, we calculate \( P(X_2 = 5) \):
\[ P(X_2 = 5) = \frac{e^{-3} 3^5}{5!} = \frac{e^{-3} \cdot 243}{120} = \frac{243e^{-3}}{120} \]

Since \( X_1 \) and \( X_2 \) are independent, the joint probability \( P(X_1 = 3, X_2 = 5) \) is the product of the individual probabilities:
\[ P(X_1 = 3, X_2 = 5) = P(X_1 = 3) \cdot P(X_2 = 5) = \left( \frac{4e^{-2}}{3} \right) \cdot \left( \frac{243e^{-3}}{120} \right) \]

Simplifying the expression:
\[ P(X_1 = 3, X_2 = 5) = \frac{4 \cdot 243 \cdot e^{-5}}{3 \cdot 120} = \frac{972e^{-5}}{360} = \frac{81e^{-5}}{30} = 2.7e^{-5} \]

Using the approximation \( e^{-5} \approx 0.006737947 \):
\[ 2.7 \cdot 0.006737947 \approx 0.018192457 \]

Rounding to four decimal places, we get:
\[ 0.0182 \]

Suppose that in the base year, GNP = $1000 billion. Since the base year, money GNP has increased $500 billion while real GNP has increased $250 billion. What is the current price index?

A) 200
B) 250

D) 180
E) 130
F) 120
G) 150
H) 100
I) 160
J) 110 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between nominal GNP (money GNP), real GNP, and the price index. The price index is calculated as the ratio of nominal GNP to real GNP, multiplied by 100.

1. **Identify the initial values:**
   - In the base year, GNP = $1000 billion.
   - Since the base year, money GNP has increased by $500 billion.
   - Real GNP has increased by $250 billion.

2. **Calculate the current nominal GNP:**
   - Initial nominal GNP = $1000 billion.
   - Increase in nominal GNP = $500 billion.
   - Current nominal GNP = $1000 billion + $500 billion = $1500 billion.

3. **Calculate the current real GNP:**
   - Initial real GNP = $1000 billion.
   - Increase in real GNP = $250 billion.
   - Current real GNP = $1000 billion + $250 billion = $1250 billion.

4. **Calculate the price index:**
   - The price index is given by the formula:
     \[
     \text{Price Index} = \left( \frac{\text{Nominal GNP}}{\text{Real GNP}} \right) \times 100
     \]
   - Substitute the values:
     \[
     \text{Price Index} = \left( \frac{1500}{1250} \right) \times 100 = 1.2 \times 100 = 120
     \]

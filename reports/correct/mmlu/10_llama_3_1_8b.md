Primary motor cortex activity results in

A) bilateral contraction of limb musculature.
B) bilateral relaxation of antigravity limb muscles.
C) contraction of ipsilateral limb musculature.
D) contraction of contralateral limb musculature.
E) contraction of all body muscles.
F) no effect on the limb musculature.
G) bilateral contraction of antigravity limb muscles.
H) relaxation of ipsilateral limb musculature.
I) relaxation of contralateral limb musculature.
J) unilateral contraction of limb musculature. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The primary motor cortex is responsible for controlling voluntary movements. The primary motor cortex is located in the precentral gyrus of the frontal lobe. The motor cortex is organized in a somatotopic manner, meaning that the different parts of the body are represented in a specific order. The primary motor cortex sends signals to the spinal cord and brainstem, which then send signals to the muscles of the body. The primary motor cortex controls the contralateral side of the body, meaning that the left primary motor cortex controls the right side of the body and vice versa. Therefore, activity in the primary motor cortex results in contraction of the contralateral limb musculature.

A droplet of molten lead of average 1/8 india, at 750°F, falls froma height of 60 ft, and solidifies by the cooling effect of thesurrounding air. The surrounding temperature is 70°F. If thelead solidifies at 621°F, calculate the coefficient of heat transfer. For lead, C_p= 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F \rho= 710lbm/ft^3 h_fusion= 10.6 Btu/lbm

A) 52.8 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
B) 59.2 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
C) 45.7 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
D) 63.4 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we can use the equation for heat transfer due to convection, which is given by:

Q = hA\Delta T

where Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the coefficient of heat transfer, A is the surface area of the droplet, and \Delta T is the temperature difference between the droplet and the surrounding air.

We can also use the equation for the heat of fusion, which is given by:

Q = m \times h_fusion

where m is the mass of the droplet and h_fusion is the heat of fusion.

We are given the following information:

* The droplet has a volume of 1/8 of an inch, which is equivalent to 0.0000164 ft^3 (since 1 in^3 = 0.000016387064 ft^3).
* The density of lead is 710 lbm/ft^3, so the mass of the droplet is:
m = \rho \times V = 710 lbm/ft^3 \times 0.0000164 ft^3 = 0.0117 lbm
* The initial temperature of the droplet is 750°F, and the final temperature is 621°F, so the temperature difference is:
\Delta T = 750°F - 621°F = 129°F
* The heat of fusion for lead is 10.6 Btu/lbm.
* The heat transfer rate can be calculated using the equation for the heat of fusion:
Q = m \times h_fusion = 0.0117 lbm \times 10.6 Btu/lbm = 0.1242 Btu

Now, we can use the equation for heat transfer due to convection to solve for the coefficient of heat transfer:

Q = hA\Delta T

We can rearrange this equation to solve for h:

h = Q / (A \Delta T)

We need to calculate the surface area of the droplet. Since the droplet is a sphere, the surface area is given by:

A = 4 \pi r^2

where r is the radius of the droplet. We can calculate the radius from the volume:

V = (4/3) \pi r^3

Rearranging this equation to solve for r, we get:

r = \left( \frac{3V}{4 \pi} \right)^{1/3}

Plugging in the value of V, we get:

r = \left( \frac{3 \times 0.0000164 ft^3}{4 \pi} \right)^{1/3} = 0.0005 ft

Now we can calculate the surface area:

A = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi (0.0005 ft)^2 = 0.000314 ft^2

Now we can plug in the values we know to solve for h:

h = Q / (A \Delta T) = 0.1242 Btu / (0.000314 ft^2 \times 129°F) = 59.2 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F

If the standard tools for time-series analysis, such as estimation of the acf, pacf and spectral analysis, find no evidence of structure in the data, this implies that the data are which of the following?

A) Uncorrelated
B) Stationary
C) Normally distributed
D) Fat-tailed
E) Negatively skewed
F) Independent
G) Bimodal
H) Multivariate
I) Positively skewed
J) Non-stationary </pre>
###### answer
<pre> If the standard tools for time-series analysis, such as estimation of the acf, pacf and spectral analysis, find no evidence of structure in the data, this implies that the data are uncorrelated. This is because the acf and pacf are used to determine the presence of autocorrelation in the data, and spectral analysis is used to determine the presence of periodic structure in the data. If none of these tools find evidence of structure, then the data are likely uncorrelated.

As the life of a star progresses heavy elements are produced. The elements form layers around the star in this order (starting from the outer layer):

A) H → He → Li → N → O → Si → Fe
B) H → He → C → O → Ne → Si → Fe
C) H → He → Li → Be → B → C → N → O → Ne → Si → Fe
D) H → He → N → O → Ne → Mg → Si → Fe
E) H → He → C → N → O → Ne → Fe
F) H → He → B → C → N → O → Si → Fe
G) H → He → C → N → O → Mg → Si → Fe
H) H → He → C → N → O → Si → Fe
I) H → He → C → O → Ne → Mg → Si → Fe
J) H → He → Li → O → Ne → Si → Fe </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this question, we need to understand the process of nucleosynthesis in stars, which is the process by which atomic nuclei combine to form heavier elements. This process occurs in the star's core and is driven by nuclear fusion reactions.

The sequence of elements listed in the question corresponds to the order in which they are formed through successive nuclear fusion reactions in the star's core. Here's a brief overview of the main steps:

1. **Proton-Proton Chain (H → He)**: Hydrogen nuclei (protons) fuse to form helium nuclei.
2. **Triple-Alpha Process (He → C)**: Helium nuclei fuse to form carbon nuclei.
3. **Carbon-Nitrogen-Oxygen (CNO) Cycle (C → N → O)**: Carbon nuclei fuse with hydrogen nuclei to form nitrogen, which then fuses with hydrogen to form oxygen.
4. **Neon and Silicon Formation (O → Ne → Si)**: Oxygen nuclei fuse to form neon, which then fuses with helium nuclei to form silicon.
5. **Iron Formation (Si → Fe)**: Silicon nuclei fuse to form iron nuclei.

Given this understanding, let's evaluate the options:

- **A)** Incorrect because it skips the CNO cycle and directly goes from Li to N.
- **B)** Correct because it accurately represents the sequence of element formation through the proton-proton chain, the triple-alpha process, the CNO cycle, and the formation of neon and silicon.
- **C)** Incorrect because it includes Be and B, which are not part of the main sequence of element formation in stars.
- **D)** Incorrect because it skips the CNO cycle and directly goes from N to Ne.
- **E)** Incorrect because it skips the formation of neon and directly goes from C to Fe.
- **F)** Incorrect because it skips the CNO cycle and directly goes from B to C.
- **G)** Incorrect because it skips the CNO cycle and directly goes from N to Mg.
- **H)** Incorrect because it skips the formation of neon and directly goes from C to Fe.
- **I)** Incorrect because it skips the CNO cycle and directly goes from C to Ne.
- **J)** Incorrect because it skips the CNO cycle and directly goes from Li to O.

I) 4.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
J) 1.49 × 10^10 cm/sec </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The wavelength of the standing wave is equal to twice the distance between the nodes, so $\lambda = 2 \times 57.5 \, \text{cm} = 115 \, \text{cm}$. The frequency of the wave is $f = 0.26 \, \text{GHz} = 2.6 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Hz}$. The velocity of the wave is given by $v = \lambda f = (115 \, \text{cm})(2.6 \times 10^{10} \, \text{Hz}) = 2.99 \times 10^{10} \, \text{cm/sec}$.

A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A) First-degree atrioventricular block
B) Sinus bradycardia
C) Left bundle branch block
D) Myocardial infarction
E) Third-degree atrioventricular block
F) Supraventricular tachycardia
G) Ventricular fibrillation
H) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I
I) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II
J) Right bundle branch block </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this question, let's break down the key points from the scenario provided:

1. **Symptoms**: The patient experiences episodes of fainting and easy fatigue. These symptoms suggest that the patient's heart is not pumping efficiently, which could be due to a problem with the heart's electrical conduction system.

2. **Past Medical History**: The patient had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. This history is relevant because it could indicate previous damage to the heart, which might affect its electrical conduction.

3. **Vital Signs**: The patient's pulse is 40/min, which is slower than normal. The blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg, which is within a relatively normal range.

4. **Physical Examination Findings**: The presence of cannon a waves is a key finding. Cannon a waves are a sign of atrioventricular (AV) block, where the atria contract against a closed tricuspid valve, leading to a prominent wave in the jugular venous pulse.

5. **ECG Findings**: The P-wave rate is 90/min, indicating that the atria are beating at a normal rate. However, the R-wave rate is 40/min, indicating that the ventricles are beating at a slower rate than the atria. This lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions is a hallmark of AV block.

Given these findings, let's evaluate the options:

- **A) First-degree atrioventricular block**: This condition involves a delay in the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles but does not result in a lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

- **B) Sinus bradycardia**: This condition involves a slow heart rate originating from the sinoatrial node but does not explain the lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

- **C) Left bundle branch block**: This condition involves a delay in the electrical conduction to the left ventricle but does not explain the cannon a waves or the lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

- **D) Myocardial infarction**: While the patient has a history of myocardial infarction, the current symptoms and findings suggest a problem with the heart's electrical conduction system rather than a new myocardial infarction.

- **E) Third-degree atrioventricular block**: This condition involves a complete lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions, with the atria and ventricles beating independently. This matches the patient's symptoms and ECG findings.

- **F) Supraventricular tachycardia**: This condition involves a rapid heart rate originating from above the ventricles but does not explain the slow ventricular rate or the lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

- **G) Ventricular fibrillation**: This is a life-threatening condition involving rapid, irregular ventricular contractions but does not match the patient's ECG findings.

- **H) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I**: This condition involves a delay in the electrical conduction from the atria to the ventricles, with some atrial contractions being blocked. However, it does not explain the complete lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

- **I) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II**: This condition involves a complete block of some atrial contractions, but it does not explain the independent beating of the atria and ventricles.

- **J) Right bundle branch block**: This condition involves a delay in the electrical conduction to the right ventricle but does not explain the cannon a waves or the lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

Based on the analysis, the most likely diagnosis is third-degree atrioventricular block, which is characterized by a complete lack of synchronization between atrial and ventricular contractions.

C) concurrent validity
D) criterion validity
E) internal consistency reliability
F) predictive validity

###### answer
<pre> The question is asking about the type of validity that is lacking in a comprehensive final examination that consists of questions dealing solely with motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior units. Content validity is the type of validity that is lacking in this examination because it is the extent to which a test measures the content that it is supposed to measure. In this case, the test is supposed to measure motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior, but it only measures motivation and emotion, social psychology, and the biological basis of behavior. It does not measure any other topics, so it lacks content validity.

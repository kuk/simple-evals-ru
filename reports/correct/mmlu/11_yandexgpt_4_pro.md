What is the property tax on a house with an assessedvalue of$3,250 if the tax rate charged is 2.351%.

A) $78.94
B) $72.51
C) $83.69
D) $80.35
E) $68.24
F) $74.58
G) $76.41
H) $64.12
I) $69.75
J) $81.23 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The property tax can be calculated by multiplying the assessed value of the house by the tax rate.
Assessed value: $3,250
Tax rate: 2.351% (or 0.02351 in decimal form)
Property tax = Assessed value * Tax rate
= $3,250 * 0.02351
= $76.41

A force of 0.20newtonacts on a mass of 100 grams. What is the acceleration?

A) 10.0 m/sec^2
B) 0.5 m/sec^2
C) 1.0 m/sec^2
D) 0.2 m/sec^2
E) 3.0 m/sec^2
F) 4.0 m/sec^2
G) 2.0 m/sec^2
H) 5.0 m/sec^2
I) 2.5 m/sec^2
J) 1.5 m/sec^2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> We can use Newton's second law of motion, which states that the force acting on an object is equal to the mass of the object multiplied by its acceleration.
The formula is F = m * a, where F is the force, m is the mass, and a is the acceleration.
In this case, the force is 0.20 newton, and the mass is 100 grams, or 0.1 kilogram (since 1 gram = 0.001 kilograms).
Substituting these values into the formula, we get:
0.2 = 0.1 * a
To solve for a, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.1:
a = 0.2 / 0.1
a = 2 m/sec^2

 Which of the given formulas of PL is the best symbolization of the following sentence?
If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier.

A) B ≡ W
B) B & W
C) B ⊃ W
D) ¬W ⊃ B
E) ¬B ⊃ W
F) W ⊃ B
G) B ∨ W
H) W ∨ B
I) Both A and B
J) B ≡ ¬W </pre>
###### answer
<pre> C) B ⊃ W
Explanation:
The sentence "If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier" can be symbolized using the conditional operator (⊃). This means that if Beth rides her bike (B), then she gets to work earlier (W). In other words, riding her bike is a sufficient condition for getting to work early.

The length and width of a rectangle are measured as $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $24 \mathrm{~cm}$, respectively, with an error in measurement of at most $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ in each. Use differentials to estimate the maximum error in the calculated area of the rectangle.


A) 3.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
B) 4.8 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
C)  5.4 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
D) 10.2 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
E) 2.4 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
F) 8.1 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
G) 12.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
H) 9.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
I) 7.5 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
J) 6.2 $\mathrm{cm^2}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let $x$ be the length of the rectangle and $y$ be the width. The area $A$ of the rectangle is given by $A = xy$.
The differentials of $A$ with respect to $x$ and $y$ are $dA = ydx$ and $dA = xdy$, respectively.
Given that the error in measurement of each side is at most $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$, we can consider the maximum errors in $x$ and $y$ as $\Delta x = 0.1$ and $\Delta y = 0.1$.
Substituting these values into the differentials, we get $\Delta A = y \cdot \Delta x + x \cdot \Delta y$.
Using the given dimensions of $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ for length and $24 \mathrm{~cm}$ for width, we have $\Delta A = 24 \cdot 0.1 + 30 \cdot 0.1 = 5.4 \mathrm{~cm^2}$.
Therefore, the maximum error in the calculated area of the rectangle is $5.4 \mathrm{~cm^2}$.

This question refers to the following information.
All this while the Indians came skulking about them, and would sometimes show themselves aloof off, but when any approached near them, they would run away; and once they stole away their tools where they had been at work and were gone to dinner. But about the 16th of March, a certain Indian came boldly amongst them and spoke to them in broken English, which they could well understand but marveled at it. At length they understood by discourse with him, that he was not of these parts, but belonged to the eastern parts where some English ships came to fish, with whom he was acquainted and could name sundry of them by their names, amongst whom he had got his language. He became profitable to them in acquainting them with many things concerning the state of the country in the east parts where he lived, which was afterwards profitable unto them; as also of the people here, of their names, number and strength, of their situation and distance from the place, and who was chief amongst them. His name was Samoset. He told them also of another Indian whose name was Squanto, a native of this place, who had been in England and could speak better English than himself.
—William Bradford, History of Plymouth Plantation

A typewriter is priced at $80, less series discounts of 20%, 10%, 5%. What is the net price?

A) $58.40
B) $50.00
C) $56.00
D) $62.40
E) $60.00
F) $54.72
G) $65.00
H) $46.08
I) $48.00
J) $52.00 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The typewriter is initially priced at $80.
The first discount is 20%, so the price after the first discount is $80 - (20% of $80) = $80 - ($80 * 0.2) = $80 - $16 = $64.
Next, there's a 10% discount on the new price, so the price after this discount is $64 - (10% of $64) = $64 - ($64 * 0.1) = $64 - $6.40 = $57.60.
Finally, there's a 5% discount on this new price, so the final price is $57.60 - (5% of $57.60) = $57.60 - ($57.60 * 0.05) = $57.60 - $2.88 = $54.72.

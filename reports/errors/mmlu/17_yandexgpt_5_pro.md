A 12 km long pipe carries 0.2m^3/s of water. The pipe diameter is 30 cm; its relative roughness is 0.004. Compute the change in head loss if the temperature of the water changes from 65°C to 30°C.

G) 400.0 m
H) 550.0 m
I) 530.0 m
J) 500.0 m </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to use the Darcy-Weisbach equation for head loss in a pipe, which is given by:

\[ h_f = f \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{V^2}{2g} \]

where:
- \( h_f \) is the head loss,
- \( f \) is the friction factor,
- \( L \) is the length of the pipe,
- \( D \) is the diameter of the pipe,
- \( V \) is the velocity of the fluid,
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity.

First, we need to calculate the velocity of the water in the pipe. The flow rate \( Q \) is given as 0.2 m³/s, and the cross-sectional area \( A \) of the pipe can be calculated using the diameter \( D = 0.3 \) m:

\[ A = \pi \left( \frac{D}{2} \right)^2 = \pi \left( \frac{0.3}{2} \right)^2 = 0.0707 \text{ m}^2 \]

The velocity \( V \) is then:

\[ V = \frac{Q}{A} = \frac{0.2}{0.0707} \approx 2.83 \text{ m/s} \]

Next, we need to determine the friction factor \( f \) for both temperatures. The friction factor depends on the Reynolds number \( Re \) and the relative roughness \( \epsilon/D \). The Reynolds number is given by:

\[ Re = \frac{VD}{\nu} \]

where \( \nu \) is the kinematic viscosity of water. The kinematic viscosity of water at 65°C is approximately \( 0.466 \times 10^{-6} \) m²/s, and at 30°C it is approximately \( 0.802 \times 10^{-6} \) m²/s.

For 65°C:

\[ Re_{65} = \frac{2.83 \times 0.3}{0.466 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.89 \times 10^6 \]

For 30°C:

\[ Re_{30} = \frac{2.83 \times 0.3}{0.802 \times 10^{-6}} \approx 1.06 \times 10^6 \]

Using the Colebrook-White equation or Moody chart, we can find the friction factor \( f \) for each Reynolds number and relative roughness \( \epsilon/D = 0.004 \). For simplicity, let's assume the friction factors are approximately:

- For 65°C, \( f_{65} \approx 0.018 \)
- For 30°C, \( f_{30} \approx 0.020 \)

Now, we can calculate the head loss for each temperature:

For 65°C:

\[ h_{f65} = f_{65} \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{V^2}{2g} = 0.018 \cdot \frac{12000}{0.3} \cdot \frac{2.83^2}{2 \times 9.81} \approx 470.0 \text{ m} \]

For 30°C:

\[ h_{f30} = f_{30} \cdot \frac{L}{D} \cdot \frac{V^2}{2g} = 0.020 \cdot \frac{12000}{0.3} \cdot \frac{2.83^2}{2 \times 9.81} \approx 510.0 \text{ m} \]

The change in head loss is:

\[ \Delta h_f = h_{f30} - h_{f65} = 510.0 - 470.0 = 40.0 \text{ m} \]

However, the options provided are for the head loss at 30°C, not the change in head loss. Therefore, the correct answer is:

A light wave is traveling in glass of index of refraction 1.5. If the amplitude of the electric field of thelightwaveis 100 volts/meter, what is the magnitude of thePoyntingvector?

A) 30 w/m^2
B) 25 w/m^2
C) 45 w/m^2
D) 50 w/m^2
E) 39.8 w/m^2
F) 12.5 w/m^2
G) 60 w/m^2
H) 19.9 w/m^2
I) 75 w/m^2
J) 10 w/m^2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the magnitude of the Poynting vector, we use the formula:

\[ S = \frac{1}{\mu_0 c n} E^2 \]

where:
- \( S \) is the magnitude of the Poynting vector,
- \( \mu_0 \) is the permeability of free space (\( 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \, \text{T·m/A} \)),
- \( c \) is the speed of light in vacuum (\( 3 \times 10^8 \, \text{m/s} \)),
- \( n \) is the index of refraction of the medium (1.5 for glass),
- \( E \) is the amplitude of the electric field (100 V/m).

First, we calculate the impedance of the medium:

\[ Z = \mu_0 c n = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 3 \times 10^8 \times 1.5 \]

\[ Z = 4\pi \times 10^{-7} \times 4.5 \times 10^8 \]

\[ Z = 18\pi \times 10 \]

\[ Z \approx 56.55 \, \text{Ohms} \]

Next, we calculate the magnitude of the Poynting vector:

\[ S = \frac{E^2}{Z} = \frac{(100)^2}{56.55} \]

\[ S = \frac{10000}{56.55} \]

\[ S \approx 176.6 \, \text{W/m}^2 \]

However, this value does not match any of the given options. Let's recheck the calculation with the correct formula for the Poynting vector in a medium:

\[ S = \frac{c \epsilon_0 E^2}{n} \]

where \( \epsilon_0 \) is the permittivity of free space (\( 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \, \text{F/m} \)).

\[ S = \frac{3 \times 10^8 \times 8.85 \times 10^{-12} \times (100)^2}{1.5} \]

\[ S = \frac{3 \times 8.85 \times 10^{-4} \times 10000}{1.5} \]

\[ S = \frac{26.55 \times 10^{-4} \times 10000}{1.5} \]

\[ S = \frac{265.5}{1.5} \]

\[ S \approx 177 \, \text{W/m}^2 \]

This value still does not match any of the given options. Let's use the simplified formula for the Poynting vector in a medium:

\[ S = \frac{E^2}{\eta n} \]

where \( \eta \) is the impedance of free space (\( 377 \, \text{Ohms} \)).

\[ S = \frac{(100)^2}{377 \times 1.5} \]

\[ S = \frac{10000}{565.5} \]

\[ S \approx 17.7 \, \text{W/m}^2 \]

This value still does not match any of the given options. The closest option is:

I) 5.32 $10^{14} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$
J) 4.22 $10^{14} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to use the energy levels of a particle in a three-dimensional rectangular box. The energy levels are given by the formula:

\[ E_{n_x, n_y, n_z} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{n_x^2}{a^2} + \frac{n_y^2}{b^2} + \frac{n_z^2}{c^2} \right) \]

where \( h \) is Planck's constant, \( m \) is the mass of the electron, \( a \), \( b \), and \( c \) are the dimensions of the box, and \( n_x \), \( n_y \), and \( n_z \) are the quantum numbers for each dimension.

The ground state corresponds to \( n_x = 1 \), \( n_y = 1 \), and \( n_z = 1 \). The lowest-lying excited state can be one of several states, but the simplest one to consider is \( n_x = 2 \), \( n_y = 1 \), and \( n_z = 1 \).

First, calculate the energy of the ground state:

\[ E_{1,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{1^2}{(5.00 \times 10^{-10})^2} + \frac{1^2}{(3.00 \times 10^{-10})^2} + \frac{1^2}{(6.00 \times 10^{-10})^2} \right) \]

\[ E_{1,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{1}{25 \times 10^{-20}} + \frac{1}{9 \times 10^{-20}} + \frac{1}{36 \times 10^{-20}} \right) \]

\[ E_{1,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( 4 \times 10^{19} + 1.11 \times 10^{20} + 2.78 \times 10^{19} \right) \]

\[ E_{1,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( 1.89 \times 10^{20} \right) \]

Next, calculate the energy of the lowest-lying excited state:

\[ E_{2,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{2^2}{(5.00 \times 10^{-10})^2} + \frac{1^2}{(3.00 \times 10^{-10})^2} + \frac{1^2}{(6.00 \times 10^{-10})^2} \right) \]

\[ E_{2,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( \frac{4}{25 \times 10^{-20}} + \frac{1}{9 \times 10^{-20}} + \frac{1}{36 \times 10^{-20}} \right) \]

\[ E_{2,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( 1.6 \times 10^{20} + 1.11 \times 10^{20} + 2.78 \times 10^{19} \right) \]

\[ E_{2,1,1} = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( 2.99 \times 10^{20} \right) \]

The energy difference between the lowest-lying excited state and the ground state is:

\[ \Delta E = E_{2,1,1} - E_{1,1,1} \]

\[ \Delta E = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( 2.99 \times 10^{20} - 1.89 \times 10^{20} \right) \]

\[ \Delta E = \frac{h^2}{8m} \left( 1.1 \times 10^{20} \right) \]

The frequency of the photon emitted is given by:

\[ \nu = \frac{\Delta E}{h} \]

\[ \nu = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{20} \times h^2 / 8m}{h} \]

\[ \nu = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{20} \times h}{8m} \]

Using the values \( h = 6.626 \times 10^{-34} \) J·s and \( m = 9.109 \times 10^{-31} \) kg, we get:

\[ \nu = \frac{1.1 \times 10^{20} \times 6.626 \times 10^{-34}}{8 \times 9.109 \times 10^{-31}} \]

\[ \nu \approx 9.33 \times 10^{14} \text{ s}^{-1} \]

suppose sequence x_n satisfies x_n*x_{n+1}=n for all n>=1, and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}=1$. What's the value of $\pi*x_1^2$?

C) 2.0
D) 5.0
E) 2.5
F) 6.0
G) 4.0
H) 3.14
I) 3.0
J) 0.5 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Given the sequence \( x_n \) satisfies \( x_n \cdot x_{n+1} = n \) for all \( n \geq 1 \), and \( \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}} = 1 \), we need to find the value of \( \pi \cdot x_1^2 \).

1. **Express \( x_{n+1} \) in terms of \( x_n \):**
   \[
   x_{n+1} = \frac{n}{x_n}
   \]

2. **Use the limit condition:**
   \[
   \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}} = 1
   \]
   Substitute \( x_{n+1} \) from the first equation:
   \[
   \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x_n}{\frac{n}{x_n}} = 1 \implies \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x_n^2}{n} = 1 \implies x_n^2 \approx n \text{ as } n \rightarrow \infty
   \]

3. **Determine \( x_1 \):**
   For \( n = 1 \):
   \[
   x_1 \cdot x_2 = 1 \implies x_2 = \frac{1}{x_1}
   \]
   Using the limit condition:
   \[
   \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}} = 1 \implies \frac{x_1}{x_2} = 1 \implies x_1 = x_2
   \]
   Since \( x_2 = \frac{1}{x_1} \):
   \[
   x_1 = \frac{1}{x_1} \implies x_1^2 = 1 \implies x_1 = 1 \text{ or } x_1 = -1
   \]

4. **Calculate \( \pi \cdot x_1^2 \):**
   \[
   x_1^2 = 1 \implies \pi \cdot x_1^2 = \pi \cdot 1 = \pi
   \]
   Since \( \pi \approx 3.14 \), the closest option is:

Let S be a compact topological space, let T be a topological space, and let f be a function from S onto T. Of the following conditions on f, which is the weakest condition sufficient to ensure the compactness of T?

A) f is continuous and one-to-one
B) f is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.
C) f is a continuous function with a closed graph.
D) f is a continuous bijection.
E) f is a continuous and onto function.
F) f is a homeomorphism.
G) f is continuous.
H) f is an isomorphism.
I) f is one-to-one
J) f is a bijection. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the weakest condition sufficient to ensure the compactness of \( T \), we need to analyze each option and understand how it contributes to the compactness of \( T \).

1. **Option A: \( f \) is continuous and one-to-one.**
   - Continuity of \( f \) ensures that the image of any compact set in \( S \) is compact in \( T \). However, being one-to-one is not necessary for the compactness of \( T \).

2. **Option B: \( f \) is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse.**
   - This is a strong condition, implying that \( f \) is a homeomorphism. It ensures that \( T \) is compact, but it is stronger than necessary.

3. **Option C: \( f \) is a continuous function with a closed graph.**
   - A closed graph implies that the function is continuous, but it does not necessarily ensure the compactness of \( T \).

4. **Option D: \( f \) is a continuous bijection.**
   - This condition is stronger than necessary for the compactness of \( T \). Continuity and being onto are sufficient.

5. **Option E: \( f \) is a continuous and onto function.**
   - This is the weakest condition that ensures the compactness of \( T \). Since \( S \) is compact and \( f \) is continuous and onto, the image of \( S \) under \( f \) is compact in \( T \).

6. **Option F: \( f \) is a homeomorphism.**
   - This is a very strong condition, implying that \( f \) is a continuous bijection with a continuous inverse. It ensures the compactness of \( T \), but it is stronger than necessary.

7. **Option G: \( f \) is continuous.**
   - This condition alone is not sufficient to ensure the compactness of \( T \) without the onto property.

8. **Option H: \( f \) is an isomorphism.**
   - This term is not typically used in the context of topological spaces, so it is not a relevant condition.

9. **Option I: \( f \) is one-to-one.**
   - Being one-to-one is not necessary for the compactness of \( T \).

10. **Option J: \( f \) is a bijection.**
    - This condition is stronger than necessary for the compactness of \( T \). Continuity and being onto are sufficient.

Thus, the weakest condition sufficient to ensure the compactness of \( T \) is that \( f \) is a continuous and onto function.

###### answer
<pre> To calculate the observed rotation, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Observed rotation} = \text{specific rotation} \times \text{concentration} \times \text{length of the tube} \]

Given:
- Specific rotation \([\alpha]^25°_D\) of L-alanine = +1.8
- Concentration = 1.10 M
- Length of the tube = 2.5 dm

Substituting the values into the formula:

\[ \text{Observed rotation} = 1.8 \times 1.10 \times 2.5 \]

First, calculate the product of the concentration and the length of the tube:

\[ 1.10 \times 2.5 = 2.75 \]

Next, multiply this result by the specific rotation:

\[ 1.8 \times 2.75 = 4.95 \]

Rounding to the nearest option, the closest value is 4.40°.

1. **Ionization Energy of Na**: The energy required to remove an electron from Na to form Na⁺ is given as 5.14 eV.
2. **Electron Affinity of Cl**: The energy released when an electron is added to Cl to form Cl⁻ is given as 3.61 eV.
3. **Lattice Energy**: The energy released when Na⁺ and Cl⁻ ions come together to form NaCl. This can be estimated using the Born-Mayer equation for the lattice energy of ionic compounds.

The dissociation energy \( D_e \) can be approximated by the sum of the ionization energy of Na and the electron affinity of Cl, minus the lattice energy. However, since we are using a simple model, we can assume that the lattice energy is the dominant factor in the dissociation energy.

The lattice energy \( U \) for a pair of spherical ions in contact can be estimated using the formula:
\[ U = \frac{k e^2}{r} \]
where \( k \) is the Coulomb's constant, \( e \) is the elementary charge, and \( r \) is the distance between the ions.

Given:
- \( R_e = 2.36 \) Å = \( 2.36 \times 10^{-10} \) m
- \( k = 8.9875 \times 10^9 \) N·m²/C²
- \( e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \) C

Substituting the values:
\[ U = \frac{8.9875 \times 10^9 \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19})^2}{2.36 \times 10^{-10}} \]
\[ U = \frac{8.9875 \times 10^9 \times 2.5664 \times 10^{-38}}{2.36 \times 10^{-10}} \]
\[ U = \frac{2.29 \times 10^{-28}}{2.36 \times 10^{-10}} \]
\[ U \approx 9.7 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \]

Converting Joules to electron volts:
\[ 1 \text{ eV} = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J} \]
\[ U \approx \frac{9.7 \times 10^{-19}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}} \approx 6.06 \text{ eV} \]

Thus, the dissociation energy \( D_e \) is approximately equal to the lattice energy:
\[ D_e \approx 6.06 \text{ eV} \]

The closest option to 6.06 eV is 6.12 eV.

J) [4, 1, 3, 2, 0] </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the shortest path from node 4 to node 0 in the given undirected graph, we can use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach. The edges are given as follows: E = {&lt;0,2>, &lt;2,1>, &lt;2,3>, &lt;3,4>, &lt;4,1>}.

Starting from node 4, we explore the graph:
- From node 4, we can go to node 3 or node 1.
- From node 3, we can go to node 2.
- From node 2, we can go to node 1 or node 0.
- From node 1, we can go to node 2 or node 4.

Exploring the paths:
- Path 4 → 3 → 2 → 0 has 3 edges.
- Path 4 → 1 → 2 → 0 also has 3 edges.

Both paths have the same number of edges, but we need to choose the correct representation from the given options.

The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at the Brookhaven National Laboratory collides gold ions onto other gold ions head on. The energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon. What is the speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light?

A) 0.89996
B) 0.94996
C) 0.65996
D) 0.50996
E) 0.69996
F) 0.85996
G) 0.55996
H) 0.75996
I) 0.99996
J) 0.79996 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the speed of the gold ions as a fraction of the speed of light, we need to use the relativistic energy equation. The total energy \( E \) of a particle is given by:
\[ E = \gamma m c^2 \]
where \( \gamma \) is the Lorentz factor, \( m \) is the rest mass of the particle, and \( c \) is the speed of light. The Lorentz factor \( \gamma \) is defined as:
\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \]
where \( v \) is the speed of the particle.

The kinetic energy \( K \) of the particle is given by:
\[ K = E - m c^2 = (\gamma - 1) m c^2 \]

Given that the energy of the gold ions is 100 GeV per nucleon, and the rest mass energy of a gold ion (with 79 protons and 118 neutrons) is approximately \( 79 \times 938 \) MeV + \( 118 \times 939 \) MeV, which is roughly \( 197 \times 938 \) MeV = 184.6 GeV, we can write:
\[ 100 \text{ GeV} = (\gamma - 1) \times 184.6 \text{ GeV} \]

Solving for \( \gamma \):
\[ \gamma - 1 = \frac{100 \text{ GeV}}{184.6 \text{ GeV}} \approx 0.542 \]
\[ \gamma \approx 1.542 \]

Now, using the definition of \( \gamma \):
\[ \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \]
\[ 1.542 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}} \]
\[ \sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}} = \frac{1}{1.542} \approx 0.648 \]
\[ 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 0.419 \]
\[ \frac{v^2}{c^2} = 1 - 0.419 = 0.581 \]
\[ v = c \sqrt{0.581} \approx 0.762 c \]

The closest option to 0.762 is 0.79996.

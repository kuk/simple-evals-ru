### formal_fallacies/33
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, whatever is an ingredient of Vertica Rush and an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad. It follows that every ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the argument step by step to determine its validity.

Premise 1: Whatever is an ingredient of Vertica Rush and an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel is not an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.
This can be represented as:
\[ (V \land L) \rightarrow \neg E \]
where \( V \) represents an ingredient of Vertica Rush, \( L \) represents an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel, and \( E \) represents an ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad.

Hypothesis: Every ingredient of Eyeshadow Quad is not an ingredient of Liqua Versa Gel or not an ingredient of Vertica Rush.
This can be represented as:
\[ E \rightarrow (\neg L \lor \neg V) \]

To determine if the hypothesis follows from the premise, we need to see if the implication \( (V \land L) \rightarrow \neg E \) logically implies \( E \rightarrow (\neg L \lor \neg V) \).

Let's break it down:

1. Assume \( E \) is true (i.e., there is an ingredient in Eyeshadow Quad).
2. According to the premise, if \( V \) and \( L \) are both true, then \( E \) must be false. However, since we assumed \( E \) is true, it cannot be the case that both \( V \) and \( L \) are true.
3. Therefore, if \( E \) is true, at least one of \( V \) or \( L \) must be false, which means \( \neg L \lor \neg V \) is true.

Thus, the hypothesis \( E \rightarrow (\neg L \lor \neg V) \) logically follows from the premise \( (V \land L) \rightarrow \neg E \).

Therefore, the argument is deductively valid. The answer is:

- valid </pre>

<pre> Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight less than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

First, we need to identify which penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.

1. **Louis**: Age = 7, Weight = 11 kg
   - More than 5 years old and weighs less than 12 kg.

2. **Bernard**: Age = 5, Weight = 13 kg
   - Not more than 5 years old.

3. **Vincent**: Age = 9, Weight = 11 kg
   - More than 5 years old and weighs less than 12 kg.

4. **Gwen**: Age = 8, Weight = 15 kg
   - More than 5 years old but weighs more than 12 kg.

From the above, only Louis and Vincent meet the criteria of being more than 5 years old and weighing less than 12 kg.

So, the number of penguins that meet the criteria is 2.

The answer is (B) 2. </pre>

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'midnight cowboy'?
Options:
(A) midnigmht cowboy
(B) midnight cow boy
(C) midnights cowboy
(D) midnight cowbory </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

The original name is "Midnight Cowboy". This is the title of an American film that won the Academy Award for Best Picture in 1969.

(A) "midnigmht cowboy": Here, "Midnight" is misspelled as "midnigmht", which is not a meaningful or humorous edit.

(B) "midnight cow boy": Here, the word "cowboy" is split into "cow" and "boy", which is a humorous and playful edit. It changes the meaning of the title in a whimsical way, making it sound like a different, perhaps more lighthearted, concept.

(C) "midnights cowboy": Here, "Midnight" is misspelled as "midnights", which is not a meaningful or humorous edit.

(D) "midnight cowbory": Here, "cowboy" is changed to "cowbory", which is not a meaningful or humorous edit.

Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B). </pre>

Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a convertible, a motorcyle, and a truck. The motorcyle is newer than the convertible. The convertible is newer than the truck.
Options:
(A) The convertible is the oldest
(B) The motorcyle is the oldest
(C) The truck is the oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The motorcyle is newer than the convertible: "convertible (newer) motorcyle".
(2) The convertible is newer than the truck: "truck (newer) convertible (newer) motorcyle".

From (1) and (2), we can deduce the following order:
"truck (newer) convertible (newer) motorcyle".

This means the truck is the oldest, the convertible is the second oldest, and the motorcyle is the newest.

So, the answer is (C) The truck is the oldest. </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Fidel tells the truth. So, we know that Fidel tells the truth.
(2) Jerry says Fidel tells the truth. Since we know from (1) that Fidel tells the truth, if Jerry says that Fidel tells the truth, then Jerry tells the truth.
(3) Vina says Jerry tells the truth. Since we know from (2) that Jerry tells the truth, if Vina says Jerry tells the truth, then Vine tells the truth.
(4) Millicent says Vina lies. Since we know from (3) that Vina tells the truth, if Millicent says Vina lies, then Millicent lies.
(5) Raymond says Millicent lies. Since we know from (4) that Millicent lies, if Raymond says Millicent lies, then Raymond tells the truth.
Now, the question asks: Does Raymond tell the truth? We know from (5) that Raymond tells the truth. So the answer is Yes.

Q: Question: Kristian lies. Millie says Kristian lies. Maybelle says Millie tells the truth. Fidel says Maybelle lies. Leda says Fidel lies. Does Leda tell the truth?

(1) Kristian lies. So, we know that Kristian lies.
(2) Millie says Kristian lies. Since we know from (1) that Kristian lies, if Millie says Kristian lies, then Millie tells the truth.
(3) Maybelle says Millie tells the truth. Since we know from (2) that Millie tells the truth, if Maybelle says Millie tells the truth, then Maybelle tells the truth.
(4) Fidel says Maybelle lies. Since we know from (3) that Maybelle tells the truth, if Fidel says Maybelle lies, then Fidel lies.
(5) Leda says Fidel lies. Since we know from (4) that Fidel lies, if Leda says Fidel lies, then Leda tells the truth.
Now, the question asks: Does Leda tell the truth? We know from (5) that Leda tells the truth. So the answer is Yes.

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Kristian tells the truth. So, we know that Kristian tells the truth.
(2) Michaela says Kristian lies. Since we know from (1) that Kristian tells the truth, if Michaela says Kristian lies, then Michaela lies.
(3) Raymond says Michaela tells the truth. Since we know from (2) that Michaela lies, if Raymond says Michaela tells the truth, then Raymond lies.
(4) Osvaldo says Raymond tells the truth. Since we know from (3) that Raymond lies, if Osvaldo says Raymond tells the truth, then Osvaldo lies.
(5) Jamey says Osvaldo tells the truth. Since we know from (4) that Osvaldo lies, if Jamey says Osvaldo tells the truth, then Jamey lies.
Now, the question asks: Does Jamey tell the truth? We know from (5) that Jamey lies. So the answer is No.

Q: Question: Jamey lies. Vernell says Jamey tells the truth. Millicent says Vernell lies. Rashida says Millicent tells the truth. Vina says Rashida tells the truth. Does Vina tell the truth? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) Jamey lies. So, we know that Jamey does not tell the truth.

(2) Vernell says Jamey tells the truth. Since we know from (1) that Jamey lies, if Vernell says Jamey tells the truth, then Vernell lies.

(3) Millicent says Vernell lies. Since we know from (2) that Vernell lies, if Millicent says Vernell lies, then Millicent tells the truth.

(4) Rashida says Millicent tells the truth. Since we know from (3) that Millicent tells the truth, if Rashida says Millicent tells the truth, then Rashida tells the truth.

(5) Vina says Rashida tells the truth. Since we know from (4) that Rashida tells the truth, if Vina says Rashida tells the truth, then Vina tells the truth.

Now, the question asks: Does Vina tell the truth? We know from (5) that Vina tells the truth. So the answer is Yes. 

However, there is a contradiction in the initial statement (1) that Jamey lies, which is then used to derive that Vina tells the truth. Let's correct the logic:

(1) Jamey lies. So, we know that Jamey does not tell the truth.

(2) Vernell says Jamey tells the truth. Since we know from (1) that Jamey lies, if Vernell says Jamey tells the truth, then Vernell lies.

(3) Millicent says Vernell lies. Since we know from (2) that Vernell lies, if Millicent says Vernell lies, then Millicent tells the truth.

(4) Rashida says Millicent tells the truth. Since we know from (3) that Millicent tells the truth, if Rashida says Millicent tells the truth, then Rashida tells the truth.

(5) Vina says Rashida tells the truth. Since we know from (4) that Rashida tells the truth, if Vina says Rashida tells the truth, then Vina tells the truth.

The contradiction arises because the initial statement about Jamey lying is used to derive the truthfulness of Vina, but Jamey's truthfulness is not directly relevant to Vina's statement about Rashida. Let's correct the logic by focusing on the chain of statements that directly involve Vina:

(1) Jamey lies. This is given and does not affect the chain of statements involving Vina.

(2) Vernell says Jamey tells the truth. Since Jamey lies, Vernell's statement is false, meaning Vernell lies.

(3) Millicent says Vernell lies. Since Vernell lies, Millicent's statement is true, meaning Millicent tells the truth.

(4) Rashida says Millicent tells the truth. Since Millicent tells the truth, Rashida's statement is true, meaning Rashida tells the truth.

(5) Vina says Rashida tells the truth. Since Rashida tells the truth, Vina's statement is true, meaning Vina tells the truth.

The corrected conclusion is that Vina tells the truth, but the initial statement about Jamey lying is not directly relevant to the chain of statements involving Vina. The key is to focus on the chain of statements that directly involve Vina:

- Since Millicent tells the truth (from (3)), and Rashida tells the truth (from (4)), Vina's statement that Rashida tells the truth is true (from (5)).

Therefore, the answer is Yes, Vina tells the truth. </pre>

1. **Source Sentence Analysis:**
   - The source sentence talks about a list of diplomatic representations in Bonn.
   - It mentions that Bonn was the seat of government of the Federal Republic of Germany from 1949 to 1999.
   - The sentence also specifies that these buildings are in the city of Bonn and its surroundings.

2. **Translation Analysis:**

3. **Error Identification:**
   - The error in the translation is related to the time period mentioned for when Bonn was the seat of government.
   - This error falls under the category of Numerical Values, as it involves a change in the dates.

Therefore, the translation contains an error pertaining to Numerical Values. The correct answer is (B). </pre>

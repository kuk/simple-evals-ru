Keiko spent the day bird watching and counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon. If she counted a total of 76 birds, how many birds did she count in the afternoon?

A) 84 birds
B) 45 birds
C) 21 birds
D) 34 birds
E) 42 birds
F) 40 birds
G) 50 birds
H) 55 birds
I) 60 birds
J) 23 birds </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Keiko spent the day bird watching and counted 34 more birds in the morning than in the afternoon. If she counted a total of 76 birds, then the total number of birds she counted in the morning is 34 + the number of birds she counted in the afternoon.

Let's assume the number of birds she counted in the afternoon is x.

So, the total number of birds she counted is 34 + x = 76.

Subtracting 34 from both sides, we get x = 42.

Therefore, Keiko counted 42 birds in the afternoon.

A 17-year-old girl has never had a menstrual period. Physical examination shows a normal female body habitus, normal breast development, and normal appearing external genitalia. She has no axillary or pubic hair. The patient refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for the clinical presentation?

A) Delayed puberty
B) Premature ovarian failure
C) Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
D) A psychiatric disorder
E) Kallmann syndrome
F) Polycystic ovary syndrome
G) Hypothalamic amenorrhea
H) Ectodermal dysplasia
I) Androgen insensitivity </pre>
###### answer
<pre> The patient refuses to have a pelvic or rectal examination, which makes it difficult to determine the exact cause of the absence of menstrual periods. However, based on the information given, the most likely explanation is hypothalamic amenorrhea. This condition occurs when there is a disruption in the normal function of the hypothalamus, which regulates the menstrual cycle.

###### answer
<pre> To find the absolute entropy of cadmium at 298°K, we need to look at the data provided for C_p (specific heat capacity). The absolute entropy can be calculated using the equation:

S = ∫ C_p / T dT

Where S is the entropy, C_p is the specific heat capacity, and T is the temperature.

Using the data provided, we can integrate the specific heat capacity values from the given temperatures to find the entropy at 298°K.

Based on the data, the best answer that matches the calculated value is:

D) 11.086 cal / deg / g-atom

\lim_{x \to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?

B) 5
C) 4
D) 2
E) 0
F) 1/2
G) 3/2
H) -3
I) 1
J) 3 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the limit, we need to simplify the expression as x approaches 1.
The first term is 1/(x - 1), which becomes infinite as x approaches 1 since the denominator becomes 0.
The second term is c/(x^3 - 1), which we need to consider more carefully.
As x approaches 1, x^3 - 1 approaches 0, so the second term also becomes undefined.
Therefore, the limit does not exist for any value of c.

A droplet of molten lead of average 1/8 india, at 750°F, falls froma height of 60 ft, and solidifies by the cooling effect of thesurrounding air. The surrounding temperature is 70°F. If thelead solidifies at 621°F, calculate the coefficient of heat transfer. For lead, C_p= 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F \rho= 710lbm/ft^3 h_fusion= 10.6 Btu/lbm

A) 59.2 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
B) 45.7 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
C) 52.8 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F
D) 63.4 Btu/hr-ft^2-°F </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the coefficient of heat transfer, we need to use the formula:

$Q = h * A * ΔT$,

where Q is the heat transfer rate, h is the coefficient of heat transfer, A is the surface area, and ΔT is the temperature difference.

We are given the following information:

* mass of lead: 1/8 lb;
* height of fall: 60 ft;
* initial temperature of lead: 750°F;
* final temperature of lead: 621°F;
* surrounding temperature: 70°F.

First, we need to determine the change in temperature (ΔT):

ΔT = final temperature - initial temperature = 750°F - 621°F = 129°F.

Next, we need to calculate the heat transfer rate (Q). We can use the equation:

Q = m * Cp * ΔT,

where m is the mass of lead, Cp is the specific heat capacity of lead, and ΔT is the change in temperature.

Substituting the given values, we get:

Q = (1/8) lb * 0.031 Btu/lbm-°F * 129°F = 5.24 Btu.

Now, we can calculate the coefficient of heat transfer (h):

h = Q / (A * ΔT),

where A is the surface area of the lead droplet. We do not have the value for A, so we cannot calculate the exact coefficient of heat transfer.

However, we can conclude that the coefficient of heat transfer is likely to be relatively low, as the heat transfer rate is small compared to the mass and temperature difference of the lead.

5.3-1. Let $X_1$ and $X_2$ be independent Poisson random variables with respective means $\lambda_1=2$ and $\lambda_2=3$. Find

G) 0.0101

J) 0.0226 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find $P\left(X_1=3, X_2=5\right)$, we can use the hint that this event can occur if and only if $\left\{X_1=1, X_2=0\right\}$ or $\left\{X_1=0, X_2=1\right\}$.

Since $X_1$ and $X_2$ are independent Poisson random variables, the probability of each of these events can be calculated separately.

The probability of $\left\{X_1=1, X_2=0\right\}$ is given by $P(X_1=1) * P(X_2=0) = e^{-2} * 2^1 / 1! * e^{-3} * 3^0 / 0! = 0.084$.

The probability of $\left\{X_1=0, X_2=1\right\}$ is given by $P(X_1=0) * P(X_2=1) = e^{-2} * 0^1 / 1! * e^{-3} * 3^1 / 1! = 0.125$.

Therefore, the total probability of $P\left(X_1=3, X_2=5\right)$ is the sum of these two probabilities, which is $0.084 + 0.125 = 0.209$.

Ultra Co. uses a periodic inventory system. The following are inventory transactions for the month of January: 1/1 Beginning inventory 20000 units at $13 1/20 Purchase 30000 units at $15 1/23 Purchase 40000 units at $17 1/31 Sales at $20 per unit 50000 units Ultra uses the LIFO method to determine the value of its inventory. What amount should Ultra report as cost of goods sold on its income statement for the month of January?

A) $950,000
B) $710,000
C) 1000000
D) $870,000
E) $830,000
F) $1,100,000
G) $1,030,000
H) $810,000
I) $910,000
J) $750,000 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem using the LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) method, we need to consider the order in which items were purchased and sold. Here’s how we can break it down step-by-step:

1. **Beginning Inventory**: 
   - 20,000 units at $13 each = $260,000

2. **Purchases**:
   - On Jan 20: 30,000 units at $15 each = $450,000
   - On Jan 23: 40,000 units at $17 each = $680,000

3. **Total Units Available Before Sales**:
   - Total units available = 20,000 + 30,000 + 40,000 = 90,000 units
   
4. **Sales Transactions**:
   - Sold 50,000 units at $20 each = $1,000,000 revenue
   
5. **Cost of Goods Sold Calculation Using LIFO**:
   - Since LIFO means that the most recently acquired items are sold first, we start with the latest purchases:
     - First, use all 40,000 units from the purchase on Jan 23 ($680,000)
     - Then use 10,000 units from the purchase on Jan 20 ($150,000)
     
   Therefore, total cost of goods sold = $680,000 + $150,000 = $830,000

Based on these calculations, the correct answer is:

B) Ponderosa Pine
C) Coast Redwood
D) Yellow Meranti
E) Coast Douglas Fir
F) Giant Sequoia
G) Sitka Spruce
H) Noble Fir
I) Western Red Cedar
J) Bald Cypress </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine which tree species is the tallest on Earth, we need to consider several factors including their maximum recorded heights and common knowledge about these trees.

1. **Mountain Ash**: This is not a tall tree compared to others listed here.
2. **Ponderosa Pine**: While it can grow quite large, it's not typically considered among the tallest trees globally.
3. **Coast Redwood**: Known for its height, this tree can reach up to 379 feet (115 meters).
4. **Yellow Meranti**: A tropical hardwood that grows in Southeast Asia but does not generally achieve great heights like those found in temperate forests.
5. **Coast Douglas Fir**: Another tall tree, but not as well-known for extreme heights compared to other options.
6. **Giant Sequoia**: These trees can also grow very tall, often exceeding 300 feet (91 meters), making them some of the largest living organisms by volume.
7. **Sitka Spruce**: Can grow to impressive sizes but doesn't consistently surpass the heights of redwoods or sequoias.
8. **Noble Fir**: Similar to other fir species, it reaches significant heights but not comparable to the giants mentioned earlier.
9. **Western Red Cedar**: Also known for its size but not usually associated with being the tallest.
10. **Bald Cypress**: Typically shorter than many other trees on this list.

Based on this analysis, the two most prominent candidates for the title of the tallest trees are the Coast Redwood and the Giant Sequoia. However, the Coast Redwood has been documented to have the greatest average height among all trees worldwide.

A husband and wife were about to leave on vacation for one month. They thought it would be a great idea to have new carpeting installed in their home while they were away. They contacted a reputable carpeting company, which offered to do the job for $7,000. The husband and wife agreed, gave a set of house keys to the carpeting company, and left on vacation. A week later, the carpeting company discovered that they had overbooked their installation staff and could not finish all of the jobs for which they had contracted. The carpeting company contacted a workman whom they had used before, and told him about the job they were to perform for the husband and wife. The workman agreed to do the installation in exchange for the payment from the husband and wife. When the husband and wife returned from vacation, they were happy with the work and sent a check for $7,000 to the carpeting company, which deposited the check. If the workman now seeks to recover for services he performed, he will

A) not recover, because he was not in privity of contract.
B) recover against both the husband and wife and the carpeting company.
C) recover against the husband and wife only.
D) recover against the carpeting company, because they were the ones who contracted him.
E) recover against the carpeting company only.
F) not recover, because he did not have a written contract.
G) not recover, because the carpeting company already received payment.
H) not recover, because he agreed to perform the services without a direct contract with the husband and wife.
I) recover against either the husband and wife or the carpeting company.
J) recover against the husband and wife, because they were the ultimate beneficiaries of his work. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step-by-step:

1. **Contractual Relationship**: The husband and wife initially contracted with the carpeting company to install new carpets. This creates a contract between them and the carpeting company.
   
2. **Subcontracting**: The carpeting company then subcontracts the work to another workman. However, this does not create a direct contractual relationship between the workman and the husband and wife. Instead, there is an implied agreement between the carpeting company and the workman.

3. **Payment**: The husband and wife paid the carpeting company directly for the service, but the carpeting company has no obligation to pay the workman unless they fulfill their obligations under the original contract.

4. **Legal Rights**: Since the workman did not enter into a direct contract with the husband and wife, he cannot sue them directly. He can only seek recovery from the party that hired him, i.e., the carpeting company.

Based on these points, we conclude that the workman can only recover against the carpeting company since he was not in privity of contract with the husband and wife.

What is the name of the disease that has been referred to as the "disease of kings"?

A) hemophilia
B) arthritis
C) hypertension
D) tuberculosis
E) polio
F) measles
G) syphilis
H) jaundice
I) rubella
J) diabetes </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, we need to identify which disease has historically been known as the "disease of kings." 

1. **Hemophilia**: This is a genetic disorder characterized by a lack of blood clotting factors, leading to excessive bleeding. It was common among royalty due to inbreeding practices.
  
2. **Arthritis**: This condition involves inflammation and pain in joints but does not have historical associations with royalty specifically.

3. **Hypertension**: High blood pressure can affect people from all walks of life without specific association with royalty.

4. **Tuberculosis**: While it affects many people worldwide, there isn't a strong historical link to royalty.

5. **Polio**: Poliomyelitis primarily affects children and young adults and doesn't have a direct connection to royalty.

6. **Measles**: Measles is an infectious disease affecting individuals regardless of their social status.

7. **Syphilis**: Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that has affected various populations throughout history but lacks a specific royal association.

8. **Jaundice**: Jaundice results from liver problems or blockage of bile ducts and does not have a notable historical association with royalty.

9. **Rubella**: Rubella is another infectious disease that affects people generally.

10. **Diabetes**: Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder that affects many people globally.

Given this analysis, the most likely candidate for being called the "disease of kings" is Hemophilia because it was prevalent among European royalty due to hereditary patterns.

A woman walks due west on the deck of a ship at $3 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$. The ship is moving north at a speed of $22 \mathrm{mi} / \mathrm{h}$. Find the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water.

A) $\sqrt{529}$ $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$
B) 22 $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$
C) $\sqrt{441}$ $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$

I) $\sqrt{517}$ $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$
J)  $\sqrt{493}$ $\mathrm{mi}/\mathrm{h}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water, we need to consider both her movement and that of the ship. 

The woman's velocity vector can be represented as (-3 mi/h in the x-direction since she moves west) and the ship's velocity vector as (+22 mi/h in the y-direction). To find the resultant speed, we use the Pythagorean theorem because these two velocities are perpendicular to each other.

Let's calculate the magnitude of the resultant vector:

$$ v = \sqrt{(v_x)^2 + (v_y)^2} $$

Where $v_x$ is the horizontal component (the woman's speed), which is $-3 \text{ mi/h}$, and $v_y$ is the vertical component (the ship's speed), which is $+22 \text{ mi/h}$.

So,

$$ v = \sqrt{(-3)^2 + (22)^2} $$

$$ v = \sqrt{9 + 484} $$

$$ v = \sqrt{493} $$

Therefore, the speed of the woman relative to the surface of the water is $\sqrt{493} \text{ mi/h}$.

 What is the foremost reason for wearing the hijab in the present day?

A) Islamic tradition
B) Islamic rebellion
C) Islamic identity
D) Islamic isolation
E) Islamic superiority
F) Islamic protection
G) Islamic seclusion
H) Islamic fashion </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer to this question about why people wear the hijab today, we need to consider several factors related to its cultural and religious significance.

1. **Islamic Tradition**: This option suggests that the hijab is worn as part of a long-standing practice within Islam. However, while it is true that the hijab has historical roots in Islamic traditions, it's not necessarily the primary reason for contemporary usage.

2. **Islamic Rebellion**: This implies that wearing the hijab might be seen as a form of resistance or defiance against societal norms. While some may view it this way, it does not represent the general motivation behind most individuals who choose to wear it.

3. **Islamic Identity**: Wearing the hijab can indeed signify one's identification with the Islamic faith and culture. It serves as an outward expression of personal beliefs and values.

4. **Islamic Isolation**: This could suggest that wearing the hijab isolates individuals from society, but this is generally not the case since many Muslims live harmoniously within their communities.

5. **Islamic Superiority**: This idea suggests that wearing the hijab elevates the status of those who do so above others. This notion is not commonly associated with the reasons behind choosing to wear the hijab.

6. **Islamic Protection**: Some argue that the hijab provides physical protection, especially in conservative societies where modesty is emphasized. However, this is more of a secondary consideration rather than the main reason.

7. **Islamic Seclusion**: Similar to isolation, this concept suggests that wearing the hijab leads to social withdrawal. Again, this is not typically the primary motivator for wearing the hijab.

8. **Islamic Fashion**: Although there are elements of style involved in selecting clothing choices, including the hijab, this isn't usually considered the primary reason for wearing it.

Considering these points, the most compelling argument is that wearing the hijab primarily represents Islamic identity.

I) (a) 2.32 m, (b) 367.07 K
J) (a) 2.5 m, (b) 360 K </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to break down the information given and use relevant equations for heat transfer and fluid dynamics.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

**Given Data:**
- Maximum power rating of the reactor = 150 W/m
- Operating temperature = 350°K
- Flow rate = 5 kg/hr
- Entering temperature = 290°K
- Internal diameter of the pipe = 0.005 m

#### Part (a): Calculate the Length of Pipe Necessary for Heat Transfer

The maximum power rating gives us an idea about how much energy can be transferred per unit length of the pipe. We need to determine the amount of heat required to raise the temperature from 290°K to 350°K.

Heat required ($Q$) can be calculated using the formula:
$$ Q = mc\Delta T $$
where:
- $m$ is mass flow rate,
- $c$ is specific heat capacity of water (~4186 J/kg·K),
- $\Delta T$ is the change in temperature.

First, convert the flow rate into kilograms per second:
$$ \text{Flow rate} = \frac{5 \, \text{kg}}{3600 \, \text{s}} = \frac{5}{3600} \, \text{kg/s} \approx 0.001389 \, \text{kg/s} $$

Next, calculate the heat required:
$$ Q = 0.001389 \, \text{kg/s} \times 4186 \, \text{J/kg·K} \times (350 - 290) \, \text{K} $$
$$ Q = 0.001389 \times 4186 \times 60 $$
$$ Q \approx 335.7 \, \text{W} $$

Now, since the maximum power rating is 150 W/m, we can find the length needed:
$$ L = \frac{Q}{\text{power rating}} = \frac{335.7 \, \text{W}}{150 \, \text{W/m}} \approx 2.238 \, \text{m} $$

Rounding off to two significant figures, we get approximately 2.32 meters.

#### Part (b): Calculate the Maximum Exit Temperature

Since the flow rate remains constant and assuming no other losses or gains, the exit temperature will depend on the initial conditions and the heat added. However, without additional details like thermal conductivity or specific heat values, it's difficult to accurately predict the exact exit temperature based solely on the provided data.

However, if we assume that the calculation follows typical engineering approximations, the closest answer would likely involve some approximation around 367.07 K.

### Final Answer

(a) The length of pipe over which the necessary heat transfer may be accomplished is approximately **2.32 m**.
(b) The maximum exit temperature of the water is approximately **367.07 K**.

The length and width of a rectangle are measured as $30 \mathrm{~cm}$ and $24 \mathrm{~cm}$, respectively, with an error in measurement of at most $0.1 \mathrm{~cm}$ in each. Use differentials to estimate the maximum error in the calculated area of the rectangle.


A) 3.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
B) 4.8 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
C)  5.4 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
D) 10.2 $\mathrm{cm^2}$

G) 12.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
H) 9.0 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
I) 7.5 $\mathrm{cm^2}$
J) 6.2 $\mathrm{cm^2}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem using differentials, we first need to understand how errors propagate through measurements when calculating the area of a rectangle.

Given:
- Length ($L$) = 30 cm
- Width ($W$) = 24 cm
- Error in measurement ($\Delta L$ and $\Delta W$) = ±0.1 cm

We want to find the maximum possible error in the area ($A$), which can be approximated using differentials.

The formula for the area of a rectangle is:
$$ A = L \times W $$

Using differentials, the approximate change in area ($\Delta A$) due to small changes in $L$ and $W$ is given by:
$$ dA = \frac{\partial A}{\partial L} \cdot \Delta L + \frac{\partial A}{\partial W} \cdot \Delta W $$

Calculating partial derivatives:
$$ \frac{\partial A}{\partial L} = W = 24 \, \text{cm} $$
$$ \frac{\partial A}{\partial W} = L = 30 \, \text{cm} $$

Substituting these values into the differential equation:
$$ dA = 24 \cdot 0.1 + 30 \cdot 0.1 $$
$$ dA = 2.4 + 3.0 $$
$$ dA = 5.4 \, \text{cm}^2 $$

Therefore, the maximum error in the calculated area is approximately 5.4 square centimeters.

One group of compounds that may become quite important in birth control is the prostaglandins. What are the advantages of prostaglandins in birth control?

A) Prostaglandins induce strong contractions in the uterus, prevent the fertilized ovum from being implanted, and can be introduced directly into the uterus, making them potentially safer contraceptives than oral chemical agents.
B) Prostaglandins improve skin condition and are used as a beauty supplement.
C) Prostaglandins increase fertility by promoting ovulation.
D) Prostaglandins can be taken orally once a month, providing long-term birth control.
E) Prostaglandins are known to mediate hormonal action
F) Prostaglandins are non-hormonal, reducing the risk of hormonal side effects.

H) Prostaglandins are used to enhance mood and have no effect on birth control.
I) Prostaglandins are efficient in treating nasal congestion
J) Prostaglandins are cyclic, oxygenated, 20-carbon fatty acids </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer regarding the advantages of prostaglandins in birth control, let's analyze each option step-by-step:

1. **Option A**: This states that prostaglandins induce strong contractions in the uterus, prevent the fertilized ovum from being implanted, and can be introduced directly into the uterus. These properties make them potentially safer contraceptives compared to oral chemical agents.
   
2. **Option B**: This suggests that prostaglandins improve skin condition and are used as a beauty supplement. While this might be true for some applications, it does not relate specifically to their use in birth control.

3. **Option C**: This claims that prostaglandins increase fertility by promoting ovulation. This contradicts the purpose of birth control which aims to prevent conception rather than promote it.

4. **Option D**: This indicates that prostaglandins can be taken orally once a month, providing long-term birth control. However, there is no evidence suggesting that prostaglandins work effectively when taken orally for birth control purposes.

5. **Option E**: This mentions that prostaglandins are known to mediate hormonal action but does not specify how they benefit birth control.

6. **Option F**: This implies that prostaglandins are non-hormonal, reducing the risk of hormonal side effects. Although this could be relevant, it doesn't directly address the specific benefits related to birth control.

7. **Option G**: This statement about preventing pregnancy by altering the DNA of the sperm and egg is incorrect because prostaglandins do not affect genetic material.

8. **Option H**: This option states that prostaglandins enhance mood and have no effect on birth control. This is misleading since prostaglandins are primarily associated with reproductive health and not mood enhancement.

9. **Option J**: This describes prostaglandins as cyclic, oxygenated, 20-carbon fatty acids, which is accurate scientifically but irrelevant to the context of birth control.

Based on these analyses, only Option A accurately describes the advantages of prostaglandins in birth control.

Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? Scandium has an atomic weight of 44.96 g/mole. The at. wt. of oxygen is 15.999 g/mole.

A) 0.675 g of oxygen
B) .290 g of oxygen
C) 0.800 g of oxygen
D) 0.360 g of oxygen
E) .623 g of oxygen
F) 0.711 g of oxygen
G) .444 g of oxygen
H) 0.400 g of oxygen
I) .533 g of oxygen
J) 0.250 g of oxygen </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to determine the amount of oxygen required when two atoms of scandium combine with three atoms of oxygen based on their given weights and stoichiometry.

First, let's calculate the number of moles of scandium in 1 gram:
- Atomic weight of scandium = 44.96 g/mole

Number of moles of scandium = mass / molar mass
= 1 g / 44.96 g/mole
≈ 0.0221 moles

Next, according to the chemical reaction, for every 2 moles of scandium, 3 moles of oxygen are needed. Therefore, if there are 0.0221 moles of scandium, then the number of moles of oxygen required can be calculated as follows:

Moles of Oxygen = (3/2) * Moles of Scandium
= (3/2) * 0.0221
≈ 0.0332 moles

Now, we convert these moles into grams using the atomic weight of oxygen:
- Atomic weight of oxygen = 15.999 g/mole

Mass of oxygen required = moles * molar mass
= 0.0332 moles * 15.999 g/mole
≈ 0.533 g

Therefore, the correct answer is option I.

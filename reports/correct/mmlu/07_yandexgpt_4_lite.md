dy/dt = \sqrt{t}, y(1) = 1. What is y(4)?

A) 2.828
B) 4.899
C) 3.456
D) 5.000
E) 8.246
F) 4.567
G) 6.778
H) 7.789
I) 9.354
J) 5.667 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find y(4), we can integrate the given differential equation dy/dt = √t with the initial condition y(1) = 1.
The integral of √t with respect to t is not an elementary function, so we cannot find a closed-form solution for y(4).
However, we can use numerical methods to approximate y(4).
Using a calculator or computer software, we can find that y(4) ≈ 5.667.

2,300 volt60-cycle power transformer. r_1 = 1.28 ohmsr_2 = 0.0467 ohm x_1= 4.24 ohmsx_2 = 0.162 ohm Calculate the regulation using the per-unit method.

F) 1.75 per cent
G) 1.5 per cent
H) 2.25 per cent
I) 1.66 per cent
J) 2.0 per cent </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the regulation using the per-unit method, we need to determine the percentage change in output voltage for a given percentage change in input voltage.

The regulation can be calculated using the formula:

Regulation = (ΔV / V) * 100,

where ΔV is the change in output voltage and V is the nominal output voltage.

Let's calculate the regulation for each component separately and then combine the results.

For r_1, the regulation is:

(ΔV_1 / V_1) * 100 = (r_2 - r_1) / r_2 * 100 = (0.0467 - 1.28) / 0.0467 * 100 ≈ -259.5%

For x_1, the regulation is:

(ΔV_2 / V_2) * 100 = (x_2 - x_1) / x_2 * 100 = (0.162 - 4.24) / 0.162 * 100 ≈ -235.8%

To find the overall regulation, we need to consider the combined effect of both components. However, without additional information or assumptions, it is difficult to determine the exact regulation using the given data.

The mass of the Earth is 5.97 × 10^24 kg. The Moon, whose center is 3.84 × 10^8 m from the Earth’s center, has mass 7.35 × 10^22 kg. Which of the following is the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon?

A) 10^9 N
B) 10^29 N
C) 10^19 N
D) 10^89 N
E) 10^59 N
F) 10^39 N
G) 10^99 N
H) 10^79 N
I) 10^49 N
J) 10^69 N </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the gravitational force between two objects, we use the formula $F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}$, where $F$ is the gravitational force, $G$ is the gravitational constant ($6.674 \times 10^{-11} \, \text{N} \cdot \text{m}^2 / \text{kg}^2$), $m_1$ and $m_2$ are the masses of the objects, and $r$ is the distance between their centers.

In this case, the mass of the Earth ($m_1$) is $5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg}$, the mass of the Moon ($m_2$) is $7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}$, and the distance between their centers ($r$) is $3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}$.

Substituting these values into the formula, we get:

$F = G \frac{5.97 \times 10^{24} \, \text{kg} \cdot 7.35 \times 10^{22} \, \text{kg}}{3.84 \times 10^8 \, \text{m}^2} \approx 2.02 \times 10^{19} \, \text{N}$

Therefore, the best estimate of the gravitational force of the Earth on the Moon is $10^{19} \, \text{N}$.

###### answer
<pre> To find the solution, we need to consider the characteristic equation and the given initial conditions.
The characteristic equation for this recurrence relation is $(r - \frac{5}{6}) (r - \frac{1}{6}) = 0$, which has roots $r = \frac{5}{6}$ and $r = \frac{1}{6}$.
The general solution can be written as the sum of the steady-state solution and the homogeneous solution.
Since the roots are not equal, the steady-state solution does not exist.
Therefore, the general solution is the homogeneous solution, which is given by the formula:
$y [n] = c_1 r_1^n + c_2 r_2^n$, where $r_1$ and $r_2$ are the roots of the characteristic equation and $c_1$ and $c_2$ are constants.
Substituting the values of $r_1$ and $r_2$, we get:
$y [n] = c_1 (\frac{3}{5})^n + c_2 (\frac{1}{6})^n$.
Using the initial conditions, we can find the values of $c_1$ and $c_2$.
Since $y [- 1] = y [- 2] = 0$, we have:
$c_1 + c_2 = 0$ and $c_ несохранённая ссылка 1 + \frac{c_2}{6} = 0$.
Solving this system of equations, we get:
$c_ неотрицательная ссылка 2 = -\frac{6}{5} c_ неотрицательная ссылка 1$.
Substituting this value of $c_ неотрицательная ссылка 2$ into the expression for $y [n]$, we get:
$y [n] = (\frac{27}{20}) (3^n) - (\frac{4}{5}) (\frac{1}{2})^n + (\frac{1}{4}) (\frac{1}{3})^n$.

<pre> To find the probability that all three events occur, we need to use the multiplication rule for independent events.
The probability that all three events occur is $P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \cdot P(C) = 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.9 = 0.36$.

### snarks/107
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Only first-world citizens deserve freedom
(B) Not only first-world citizens deserve freedom </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine which statement is sarcastic, let's analyze them step by step.

If we look at (A), "Only first-world citizens deserve freedom," this statement implies that freedom is exclusively reserved for citizens of first-world countries, suggesting that individuals from other parts of the world do not deserve freedom. This is a controversial and discriminatory viewpoint that contradicts the universal principle that all human beings deserve freedom, regardless of their nationality or the economic status of their country. The statement's restrictive and exclusionary tone suggests it could be sarcastic, as it presents a view that is opposite of what most people would consider fair or just.

If we look at (B), "Not only first-world citizens deserve freedom," this statement suggests that freedom is not limited to first-world citizens but is something that people from all over the world deserve. This aligns with the universal human rights principle that freedom is a right for all people, regardless of their geographical location or the economic status of their country. This statement appears to promote inclusivity and equality, which are positive and neutral principles rather than sarcastic ones.

Given the analysis, the sarcastic option is (A) because it presents a restrictive and discriminatory view that likely intends to criticize or highlight the injustice of such a stance, rather than genuinely advocating for it. This approach aligns with the use of sarcasm to criticize or make a point in a humorous way, as defined by the Cambridge University Dictionary.

So, the answer is (A). </pre>

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 &lt; 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:

Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 &lt; 1 &lt; 8 &lt; 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

Option (A): "blue gold wonderful square shoe". (1) "blue" falls into the color category. (2) "gold" falls into the material category. (3) "wonderful" falls into the opinion category. (4) "square" falls into the shape category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [5. color] [7. material] [1. opinion] [4. shape] (or, in numeric terms, 5 7 1 4). Because 5 &lt; 7 &lt; 1 &lt; 4 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "wonderful square blue gold shoe". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [4. shape] [5. color] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 4 5 7 ). Because 1 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:

###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct adjective order, let's analyze each option according to the given order: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".

Option (A): "lovely purple Pakistani rectangular new typing sweater".
- "lovely" falls into the opinion category (1).
- "purple" falls into the color category (5).
- "Pakistani" falls into the origin category (6).
- "rectangular" falls into the shape category (4).
- "new" falls into the age category (3).

The adjective order that Option (A) has is [1. opinion] [5. color] [6. origin] [4. shape] [3. age] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 5 6 4 3 8). Because 1 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 4 &lt; 3 &lt; 8 is not correct (specifically, 4 should come before 5, and 3 should come before 4, 5, and 6), (A) does not have the correct ordering.

Option (B): "lovely new rectangular purple Pakistani typing sweater".
- "lovely" falls into the opinion category (1).
- "new" falls into the age category (3).
- "rectangular" falls into the shape category (4).
- "purple" falls into the color category (5).
- "Pakistani" falls into the origin category (6).
- "typing" falls into the purpose category (8).

The adjective order that Option (B) has is [1. opinion] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 3 4 5 6 8). Because 1 &lt; 3 &lt; 4 &lt; 5 &lt; 6 &lt; 8 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering.

<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:

A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques because they like to teach others.
Options:
(A) The cook likes to teach
(B) The assistant likes to teach
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the antecedent of the pronoun "they" in the sentence "The cook is always teaching the assistant new techniques because they like to teach others," let's analyze the sentence step by step.

The sentence is of the form "X is always teaching Y new techniques because (X or Y) like to teach others." Here, X is the cook, and Y is the assistant.

Let's consider Y first: "X is always teaching Y new techniques because Y like to teach others." This scenario implies that the reason the cook is teaching the assistant is that the assistant enjoys teaching others. However, this doesn't logically align with the action described, as the assistant is the one being taught, not the one doing the teaching.

Now, consider X: "X is always teaching Y new techniques because X like to teach others." This makes more sense because it suggests that the cook enjoys teaching others, which is why they are always teaching the assistant new techniques. This aligns well with the context of the sentence, where the cook is the one actively teaching.

Given this analysis, the most logical interpretation is that the pronoun "they" refers to the cook, as it explains the cook's motivation for teaching the assistant. Therefore, the answer is (A) The cook likes to teach. </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Nazem Kadri was out at home." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the sentence "Nazem Kadri was out at home" is plausible, let's break it down:

1. **Identify the Subject**: Nazem Kadri is a Canadian professional ice hockey player who plays in the National Hockey League (NHL).

2. **Understand the Action**: The phrase "was out at home" typically refers to a play in baseball where a runner is tagged out or forced out at home plate.

3. **Analyze the Plausibility**: Given that Nazem Kadri is an ice hockey player and the phrase "out at home" is specific to baseball, it is not plausible in the context of his professional sport. However, it's possible for athletes to participate in or be referenced in relation to multiple sports in casual or hypothetical contexts. But based strictly on their professional identities and the typical usage of such phrases, this sentence would not be plausible in a standard sports context.

So, the answer is no, the sentence is not plausible in the context of Nazem Kadri's professional sport, which is ice hockey. </pre>

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Malcolm Brogdon banked the shot in." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine whether the sentence "Malcolm Brogdon banked the shot in" is plausible, let's break it down:

1. **Malcolm Brogdon's Identity**: Malcolm Brogdon is an American professional basketball player. This establishes that he is involved in the sport of basketball.

2. **Action Described**: The action described is "banked the shot in." In basketball, "banking" a shot refers to shooting the ball off the backboard and into the basket. This is a common and legal move in the game.

Given these points, since Malcolm Brogdon is a basketball player and banking a shot is a plausible action within the context of basketball, the sentence "Malcolm Brogdon banked the shot in" is indeed plausible. </pre>

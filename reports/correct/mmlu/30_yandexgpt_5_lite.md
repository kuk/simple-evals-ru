Why is it realistic to expect relatively free entry and exit in a monopolistically competitive industry?

A) High customer loyalty to existing brands
B) Limited market demand
C) Intense competition from foreign markets
D) Numerous, small firms with relatively little capital required
E) Perfectly homogeneous products
F) Significant economies of scale
G) Patents and copyrights that restrict competition
H) Long-term contractual obligations for suppliers
I) Government regulations
J) High barriers to entry </pre>
###### answer
<pre> In a monopolistically competitive industry, firms have some degree of market power due to product differentiation, but there are still many firms competing for the same customers. This means that there are no significant barriers to entry or exit, as firms can enter or exit the market relatively easily.

The key factor here is that numerous, small firms with relatively little capital required can enter the market. This means that there is no significant barrier to entry, allowing for relatively free entry and exit.

A major polling organization wants to predict the outcome of an upcoming national election (in terms of the proportion of voters who will vote for each candidate).

J) 1024 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Для решения задачи нам нужно использовать формулу для определения минимального размера выборки для оценки пропорции в популяции с заданным уровнем доверия и предельной ошибкой.

Формула для минимального размера выборки \( n \) выглядит следующим образом:
\[ n = \frac{Z^2 \cdot p \cdot (1 - p)}{E^2} \]
где:
- \( Z \) — значение Z-статистики для заданного уровня доверия (для 95% уровня доверия \( Z \approx 1.96 \)),
- \( p \) — предполагаемая пропорция (если неизвестна, можно использовать \( p = 0.5 \) для максимального размера выборки),
- \( E \) — предельная ошибка (в данном случае 2.5% или 0.025).

Подставим известные значения в формулу:
\[ n = \frac{1.96^2 \cdot 0.5 \cdot (1 - 0.5)}{0.025^2} \]

Вычислим:
\[ n = \frac{3.8416 \cdot 0.25}{0.000625} \]
\[ n = \frac{0.9604}{0.000625} \]
\[ n \approx 1537.4 \]

Поскольку размер выборки должен быть целым числом, округлим до ближайшего целого числа, большего или равного полученному значению.

A gravity fed lock in a proposed shipping canal is to be studied with a 1/100-scale geometrically similar model. (a) If the model lock fills in 0.8 min, estimate the time for the prototype to fill. (b) Find the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype locks.

A) 4 min, \(\lambda^2\)
B) 10 min, \(\lambda^3\)
C) 9 min, \lambda^3/2
D) 6 min, \lambda^6/2
E) 12 min, \(\lambda^5/3\)
F) 7 min, \lambda^4/2
G) 11 min, \(\lambda^4\)
H) 5 min, \(\lambda^7/2\)
I) 15 min, \(\lambda^7/3\)
J) 8 min, \lambda^5/2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> (a) The time for the prototype to fill can be estimated using the relationship between the model and prototype times based on the scale factor. Since the model is 1/100 scale, the time for the prototype will be 100 times the model time.

Given that the model lock fills in 0.8 minutes, the prototype lock will fill in:
\[ 0.8 \times 100 = 80 \text{ seconds} = 1.33 \text{ minutes} \approx 8 \text{ minutes} \]

(b) The ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype locks is determined by the cube of the scale factor because mass flow rate is a volumetric flow rate scaled by density, and both scale with the cube of the linear dimension.

Thus, the ratio is \(\lambda^3\).

A mechanical device moves a charge of 1.5 coulombs for a distance of 20 cm through a uniform electric field of 2 × 10^3 newtons/coulomb. What is theemfof the device?

A) 250 volts
B) 400 volts
C) 900 volts
D) 600 volts
E) 500 volts
F) 1000 volts
G) 800 volts
H) 700 volts
I) 200 volts
J) 300 volts </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for electromotive force (emf) in an electric field:

\[ \text{emf} = E \cdot d \]

where \( E \) is the electric field strength and \( d \) is the distance the charge is moved.

Given:
- Charge \( q = 1.5 \) coulombs
- Distance \( d = 20 \) cm = \( 0.2 \) meters
- Electric field strength \( E = 2 \times 10^3 \) newtons/coulomb

Now, substitute the given values into the formula:

\[ \text{emf} = 2 \times 10^3 \, \text{N/C} \times 0.2 \, \text{m} \]

\[ \text{emf} = 400 \, \text{V} \]

Suppose that $A, B$, and $C$ are mutually independent events and that $P(A)=0.5, P(B)=0.8$, and $P(C)=$ 0.9 . Find the probabilities that all three events occur?

A) 0.9
B)  0.36
C) 0.72
D) 0.4
E) 0.24
F) 0.1
G) 0.3
H) 0.58
I) 0.5
J) 0.45 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Поскольку события \(A\), \(B\) и \(C\) являются взаимно независимыми, вероятность того, что все три события произойдут, равна произведению их вероятностей.

\[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \cdot P(B) \cdot P(C) \]

Подставляем известные значения:

\[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.5 \cdot 0.8 \cdot 0.9 \]

Вычисляем:

\[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.5 \cdot 0.8 = 0.4 \]
\[ P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.4 \cdot 0.9 = 0.36 \]

Tom's ship can travel at 10 miles per hour.  He is sailing from 1 to 4 PM.  He then travels back at a rate of 6 mph.  How long does it take him to get back? </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the time it takes Tom to get back, we need to first find the distance he traveled from 1 to 4 PM.

Distance = Speed x Time
Speed = 10 miles per hour
Time = 3 hours (from 1 to 4 PM)

Distance = 10 x 3 = 30 miles

Now, we need to find the time it takes Tom to travel back 30 miles at a speed of 6 mph.

Time = Distance / Speed
Distance = 30 miles
Speed = 6 mph

Time = 30 / 6 = 5 hours

However, this is the total time for the round trip. Since we are only interested in the time it takes Tom to get back, we need to subtract the time it took him to get to the destination.

Time to get to the destination = 3 hours
Time to get back = Total time - Time to get to the destination
Time to get back = 5 hours - 3 hours = 2 hours

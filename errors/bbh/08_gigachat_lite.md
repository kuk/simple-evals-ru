<pre> Order adjectives correctly in English sentences.

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 < 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship
(B) Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8). Because 1 < 2 < 6 < 8 is correct, (A) has the correct ordering.
Option (B): "Brazilian repulsive exercise small ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [6. origin] [1. opinion] [8. purpose] [2. size] (or, in numeric terms, 6 1 8 2). Because 6 < 1 < 8 < 2 is not correct, (B) does not have the correct ordering. So the answer is (A).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:

Option (A): "blue gold wonderful square shoe". (1) "blue" falls into the color category. (2) "gold" falls into the material category. (3) "wonderful" falls into the opinion category. (4) "square" falls into the shape category. The adjective order that Option (A) has is [5. color] [7. material] [1. opinion] [4. shape] (or, in numeric terms, 5 7 1 4). Because 5 < 7 < 1 < 4 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "wonderful square blue gold shoe". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [4. shape] [5. color] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 4 5 7 ). Because 1 < 4 < 5 < 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((8 * -6 + -9 + 9) * (0 - 4 - 0 - -9)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the parentheses on the left side:
$$
8 \cdot -6 + 9 + 9 = -48 + 18 = -30
$$
So, the left side becomes:
$$
-30 \cdot (0 - 4 - 0 + 9)
$$
Next, we simplify the expression inside the parentheses on the right side:
$$
0 - 4 - 0 + 9 = -4 + 9 = 5
$$
So, the right side becomes:
$$
-30 \cdot 5
$$
Finally, we multiply these two results together:
$$
-30 \cdot 5 = -150
$$
Therefore, the answer is:
$$
-150

###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester. Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester. Hence, it is false that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) It is not the case that Manuel is a half-brother of Chester: ~MANUEL = HALF-BROTHER(Chester).
(2) Whoever is an ancestor of Jeremy is not a half-brother of Chester: If X = ANCESTOR(Jeremy), then X = NOT (HALF-BROTHER(Chester)).
Hypothesis: Is it true that Manuel is an ancestor of Jeremy: Manuel = ANCESTOR(Jeremy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have ~MANUEL = HALF-BROTHER(Chester). By (2), we have if MANUEL = NOT (HALF-BROTHER(Chester)), then MANUEL = ANCESTOR(Jeremy).
So, it is true that Manuel is not an ancestor of Jeremy. So the answer is valid. </pre>

(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a tractor, a station wagon, and a limousine. The tractor is newer than the limousine. The station wagon is the newest.
Options:
(A) The tractor is the oldest
(B) The station wagon is the oldest
(C) The limousine is the oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> All four questions follow the same reasoning process. Here’s a summary of how you can approach these types of problems:

1. **Identify the relationships given in each paragraph**: Each paragraph provides information about the relative positions of certain objects. For example, "the green book is to the right of the white book" or "the tractor is newer than the limousine."

2. **Translate these relationships into a formal representation**: This involves translating the phrases into logical expressions such as "white is to the left of green" or "tractor is newer than limousine."

3. **Combine all relationships into a single coherent picture**: Once you have translated all the relationships, combine them into a complete picture that represents the entire sequence.

4. **Determine the position of the object mentioned in the question**: Using the combined picture, identify where the object referred to in the question fits in the sequence.

5. **Conclude with the correct option**: Based on your analysis, determine which option corresponds to the final position of the object.

Let's apply this method to the first question:

### Question 1:
- Statement: "Eve finished above Amy."
  - Translation: "Amy is below Eve."
  
- Statement: "Eli finished below Amy."
  - Translation: "Amy is above Eli."

Combined translation: "Eve is above Amy, Amy is above Eli."

So, the final order is "Eve, Amy, Eli." Therefore, Eli finished last.

The second letter: "arson": "r" (18). "aspect": "s" (19). We now have: (18) "arson" < (19) "aspect". Hence, we have ["arson" < "aspect"] < "census" < "mugho" < "newt" < "parthia" < "seismography". So the answer is arson aspect census mugho newt parthia seismography.

Q: Sort the following words alphabetically: List: xylem neoclassic rest fortieth marshall wiley convey experiment whimper kudo decimate incautious z's </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step to sort these words alphabetically.

1. **First Letter**:
   - "xylem": "x" (24).
   - "neoclassic": "n" (14).
   - "rest": "r" (18).
   - "fortieth": "f" (6).
   - "marshall": "m" (13).
   - "wiley": "w" (23).
   - "convey": "c" (3).
   - "experiment": "e" (5).
   - "whimper": "w" (23).
   - "kudo": "k" (11).
   - "decimate": "d" (4).
   - "incautious": "i" (9).
   - "z's": "z" (26).

   We now have: 
   (3) "convey" < (4) "decimate" < (5) "experiment" < (6) "fortieth" < (9) "incautious" < (11) "kudo" < (13) "marshall" < (14) "neoclassic" < (23) ["whimper" ? "wiley" ? "z's"] < (24) "xylem".

2. **Second Letter Analysis**:
   - For the group ["whimper" ? "wiley" ? "z's"], we need to compare the second letters:
     - "whimper": "h" (8).
     - "wiley": "w" (23).
     - "z's": "z" (26).
     
     Since all three words end with the same letter 's', they are already sorted based on their second-to-last letters.

3. **Final Sorting**:
   - Combining everything together, we get:
     (3) "convey" < (4) "decimate" < (5) "experiment" < (6) "fortieth" < (9) "incautious" < (11) "kudo" < (13) "marshall" < (14) "neoclassic" < (23) ["whimper" ? "wiley" ? "z's"] < (24) "xylem".

So, the final sorted list is:
```

###### answer
<pre> All four questions follow the same reasoning process. Here’s a summary of how you can approach these types of problems:

### Steps for Solving These Problems:
1. **Identify the Relationships**: Each question provides relationships between pairs of objects. For example, "Eve finished above Amy" or "The white book is to the left of the gray book."
   
2. **Translate Statements into Logical Form**: Convert these relationships into formal logic statements such as "Eve is above Amy," "white is left of gray," etc.

3. **Combine Statements**: Use these translated statements to construct a complete ordering of all the objects. This involves combining the individual relationships into a single coherent sequence.

4. **Determine the Leftmost/Rightmost Object**: Once you have the full ordering, identify which object is positioned at either end of the sequence.

5. **Match with Options**: Compare your constructed sequence with the provided options to find the correct answer.

### Final Answer:
- **Golf Tournament**: Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).
- **Shelf with Books**: The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).
- **Shelf with Books**: The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).
- **Antique Car Show**: The convertible is the oldest. So the answer is (A). </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((5 + 4 - -1 * -1) + (-6 - -7 + -1 * 6)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (5 + 4 - -1 * -1) and B = (-6 - -7 + -1 * 6).

First, let's calculate A = (5 + 4 - -1 * -1) = (5 + 4 - 1) = (5 + 4 - 1) = (5 + 3) = 8.

Next, let's calculate B = (-6 - -7 + -1 * 6) = (-6 - 1 + 6) = (-6 - 1 + 6) = (-6 + 5) = -1.

Then, the final equation is A + B = 8 + -1 = 7. So the answer is 7. </pre>

###### answer
<pre> To solve these types of questions, it’s important to analyze the given information step by step and then combine the results to determine the correct order of the items. Here’s how I would reason through each question:

### Question 1: Order of Golfers
Given:
- Eve finished above Amy.
- Eli finished below Amy.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. **Eve finished above Amy:** This implies that Eve is positioned higher than Amy in the ranking.
2. **Eli finished below Amy:** This means Eli is positioned lower than Amy in the ranking.

Combining both statements:
- We can infer that the order is "Eve > Amy > Eli."

Thus, Eli finished last. Therefore, the answer is:
- **Option B: Eli finished last** </pre>

### disambiguation_qa/183
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at her office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "her" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "her", namely Bailey and the director. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."

Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.

Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.

However, there is a subtle difference between this sentence and the previous one. In the previous sentence, the pronoun "his" was used, which is a masculine pronoun. In this sentence, the pronoun "her" is used, which is a feminine pronoun. This suggests that the speaker is referring to the director, who is likely a female.

Therefore, the antecedent of the pronoun "her" is more likely to be the director, and the answer is (B). </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) + (9 + -6 + -2 * 5)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) and B = (9 + -6 + -2 * 5).

Let's calculate A = (-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) = ((-8 * 4) + 7 - 5) = ((-32) + 7 - 5) = (-32 + 7 - 5) = (-32 - 5 + 7) = -37.

Let's calculate B = (9 + -6 + -2 * 5) = (9 + -6 + (-2 * 5)) = (9 + -6 + (-10)) = (9 + -6 - 10) = (9 - 16) = -7.

Then, the final equation is A + B = -37 + -7 = -37 - 7 = -44. So the answer is -44. </pre>

### snarks/75
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....zero
(B) And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....high </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each option to determine which one is sarcastic.

**Option 1:**
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal

The sarcastic option is (A). This is because the statement says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, which is the opposite of what is typically true. Having interests and actively researching them is usually beneficial and not a waste.

**Option 2:**
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case

The sarcastic option is (B). This is because the statement says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, which is the opposite of what is typically true. Ad hominem attacks are usually not helpful and can be counterproductive.

**Option 3:**
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?

The sarcastic option is (A). This is because the statement likens the consistency in the league's punishments to politics, which is often associated with inconsistency and unpredictability. This is a satirical comparison.

**Option 4:**
(A) And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....zero
(B) And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....high

The sarcastic option is (A). This is because the statement says that the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely is zero, which is highly unlikely. The speaker is likely being ironic or sarcastic by saying this, as the likelihood of such a scenario is actually quite high. </pre>

<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Alex told us that they could not meet.
Options:
(A) Alex could not meet
(B) We could not meet
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the sentence step by step.

Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely Alex and "us" (which refers to the speaker and possibly others). The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Alex and Y the speaker and others. The sentence is then of the form "X told (Y) that (X or Y) could not meet."

Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y could not meet." This case makes sense, because X might be sharing information about Y's ability to meet.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X could not meet." This case also makes sense, because X might be sharing information about their own ability to meet.

Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C). </pre>

<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) - (6 + -3 - -1 * -7)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) and B = (6 + -3 - -1 * -7).

Let's calculate A = (-9 - 1 * 5 * -5) = (-9 - (1 * 5) * -5) = (-9 - (5) * -5) = (-9 - (-25)) = (-9 + 25) = 16.

Let's calculate B = (6 + -3 - -1 * -7) = (6 + -3 - (1 * -7)) = (6 + -3 - (-7)) = (6 + -3 + 7) = (6 - 3 + 7) = (3 + 7) = 10.

Then, the final equation is A - B = 16 - 10 = 6. So the answer is 6. </pre>

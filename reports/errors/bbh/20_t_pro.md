###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Here comes a perfectly valid argument: To begin with, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika. Moreover, every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha. Finally, being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine. We may conclude: Being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha or an ancestor of Janice or a close friend of Shanika: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha) OR X = ancestor(Janice) OR X = close-friend(Shanika).

(2) Every close friend of Francine is a cousin of Samantha: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha).

(3) Being a close friend of Shanika is necessary for being a close friend of Francine: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = close-friend(Shanika).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine: If X = close-friend(Francine), then X = ancestor(Janice)?

Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1), (2), and (3) by logical reasoning?

From (2), we know that if X = close-friend(Francine), then X = cousin(Samantha). This means that the "ancestor of Janice" part of (1) is not necessary for being a close friend of Francine, because (2) already covers all close friends of Francine as cousins of Samantha.

From (3), we know that if X = close-friend(Francine), then X = close-friend(Shanika). This means that the "close friend of Shanika" part of (1) is necessary for being a close friend of Francine.

Given (2) and (3), we can conclude that all close friends of Francine are cousins of Samantha and close friends of Shanika. There is no need to invoke the "ancestor of Janice" part of (1) to satisfy the conditions for being a close friend of Francine.

Therefore, the Hypothesis that "being an ancestor of Janice is necessary for being a close friend of Francine" cannot be deduced from the premises. The argument is invalid. 

So the answer is invalid. </pre>

A: Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, then and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. The date tomorrow is Jan 3, 1963, that is 01/03/1963. So the answer is (B).

(E) 05/02/1961
(F) 11/18/1960 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, and it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. To find the date a month ago, we subtract one month from Jan 2, 1963. One month before Jan 2 is Dec 2, 1962. However, since the options are in MM/DD/YYYY format, we need to adjust the year to match the options provided. The closest year in the options to 1962 is 1960, but since we are looking for a date a month ago from Jan 2, 1963, the correct year is 1962. Therefore, the correct date a month ago is Dec 2, 1962, which in MM/DD/YYYY format is 12/02/1962. However, this exact date is not listed in the options. The closest option to this date is (D) 12/02/1960, but it is not the correct year. Since there is no option for 12/02/1962, the question seems to have an error in the options provided. If we were to choose the closest option with the correct month and day, it would be (D) 12/02/1960, but this is not the accurate answer based on the given context. </pre>

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'batman begins'?
Options:
(A) barman begins
(B) batman bewins
(C) hatman begins
(D) batman begin </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

The original name is "Batman Begins". This is the title of a movie from the Batman film series.

(A) "barman begins": Here, "batman" is changed to "barman". "Barman" is a real word referring to a bartender, which creates a humorous and absurd twist on the original title, making it sound like a completely different kind of story.

(B) "batman bewins": Here, "begins" is changed to "bewins", which is not a real word and does not create a humorous or meaningful edit.

(C) "hatman begins": Here, "batman" is changed to "hatman". While it's a playful change, it doesn't create the same level of humor or absurdity as "barman".

(D) "batman begin": Here, "begins" is changed to "begin", which is a minor grammatical change and does not add any humor.

Among the options, (A) "barman begins" is the most humorous edit because it creates a clear and funny image that contrasts with the original title. So the answer is (A). </pre>

(A) The convertible is the third-oldest
(B) The truck is the third-oldest
(C) The tractor is the third-oldest
(D) The limousine is the third-oldest
(E) The motorcyle is the third-oldest
(F) The hatchback is the third-oldest
(G) The sedan is the third-oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. The hatchback is the fourth-newest: This means there are three vehicles newer than the hatchback. Let's denote the order from newest to oldest as follows: 
   - Newest: ?, ?, ?, Hatchback, ?, ?, ?

2. The sedan is the second-newest: This means the sedan is the second vehicle from the newest end.
   - Newest: ?, Sedan, Hatchback, ?, ?, ?, ?

3. The hatchback is older than the convertible: This means the convertible is newer than the hatchback.
   - Newest: ?, Sedan, Hatchback, Convertible, ?, ?, ?

4. The tractor is newer than the convertible: This means the tractor is one of the vehicles newer than the hatchback but older than the sedan.
   - Newest: ?, Sedan, Tractor, Hatchback, Convertible, ?, ?

5. The truck is newer than the motorcycle: This means the motorcycle is older than the truck. We also know the motorcycle is older than the limousine. Let's place the motorcycle and truck in the remaining spots, keeping in mind the motorcycle is older than the limousine.
   - Newest: Sedan, Tractor, Hatchback, Convertible, Motorcycle, Truck, ?

6. The limousine is older than the motorcycle: This means the limousine is the oldest vehicle.
   - Newest: Sedan, Tractor, Hatchback, Convertible, Motorcycle, Truck, Limousine

Now, let's determine the third-oldest vehicle:
- Newest: Sedan, Tractor, Hatchback, Convertible, Motorcycle, Truck, Limousine (oldest)
- Third-oldest: Convertible

The answer is (A) The convertible is the third-oldest. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are all allowed to use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step. In this scenario, we are told that "If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail." Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turned on their lamps at the same time on Thursday, and the breaker failed. A typical person would understand that the failure of the circuit breaker was due to the combined action of all four people turning on their lamps simultaneously, not just Jim's action alone. However, since Jim was one of the four who turned on his lamp, his action was part of the cause. Therefore, a typical person would likely say that Jim's action contributed to the failure, but it was not the sole cause. Nonetheless, because the question asks if Jim turning on his lamp "caused" the failure, and his action was necessary for the failure to occur, the typical answer would be Yes, acknowledging that it was part of a collective cause. So the answer is Yes. </pre>

<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Is Fred a cousin of Robert? Is Joe related to Bob? In large families, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of all one's relatives. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: First of all, whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig. Next, there is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. It follows that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) Whoever is not a half-brother of Steven is a great-grandfather of Craig: If X = NOT (half-brother(Steven)), then X = great-grandfather(Craig).

(2) There is somebody who is a great-grandfather of Craig and, in addition, not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo: There exists an X such that X = great-grandfather(Craig) AND (X = NOT (ancestor(Jordon)) OR X = NOT (stepbrother(Gustavo))).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo: NOT (for all X, if X = half-brother(Steven), then X = ancestor(Jordon) AND X = stepbrother(Gustavo))?

Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning:

From (1), we know that if someone is not a half-brother of Steven, they are a great-grandfather of Craig. This does not directly tell us anything about half-brothers of Steven.

From (2), we know there exists at least one person who is a great-grandfather of Craig and is either not an ancestor of Jordon or not a stepbrother of Gustavo. By (1), this person is not a half-brother of Steven. However, this does not directly address the properties of half-brothers of Steven.

To deduce the Hypothesis, we need to show that there is at least one half-brother of Steven who is not both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo. The second premise (2) tells us that there is someone who is a great-grandfather of Craig and does not satisfy both conditions (ancestor of Jordon and stepbrother of Gustavo). By (1), this person is not a half-brother of Steven, so we need to consider the half-brothers of Steven.

However, (2) does not provide any information about half-brothers of Steven directly. It only tells us about someone who is not a half-brother of Steven. Therefore, we cannot conclude from (1) and (2) that not every half-brother of Steven is both an ancestor of Jordon and a stepbrother of Gustavo.

Thus, the argument is invalid. The answer is invalid. </pre>

<pre> Let's think step by step.

1. **Source Sentence Translation**: The correct translation of the source sentence "Schwechat ist eine Stadtgemeinde mit 19.570 Einwohnern südöstlich von Wien, am Fluss Schwechat." should be "Schwechat is a town with 19,570 inhabitants southeast of Vienna, on the river Schwechat."

2. **Provided Translation**: The provided translation is "Schwechat is a municipality on the dam Schwechat."

3. **Identifying the Error**:
   - The original source mentions "am Fluss Schwechat," which means "on the river Schwechat."
   - The provided translation says "on the dam Schwechat," which changes "river" to "dam." This is a change in the type of entity (from river to dam).

4. **Error Type**: Since the entity "river" is changed to "dam," this is an error pertaining to Named Entities.

Therefore, the translation contains an error pertaining to Named Entities. The answer is (D). </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the black wire cause the short circuit?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step. In this scenario, we are told that the machine will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. It is also mentioned that the machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. Since both wires touched the battery simultaneously and caused the short circuit, a typical person would consider that both wires contributed to the short circuit. However, since the black wire was the one designated to touch the battery and its contact was necessary for the short circuit to occur, a typical person might conclude that the black wire played a crucial role in causing the short circuit. Therefore, the answer is Yes, the black wire caused the short circuit, because without it touching the battery, the short circuit would not have happened. </pre>

(E) 02/23/1968
(F) 02/23/1966 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

If today is the second day of the third month of 1966, then today's date is March 2, 1966 (03/02/1966). One week ago from today would be seven days before March 2, 1966. Counting back seven days from March 2, we get February 25, 1966. Therefore, the date one week ago from today is 02/25/1966. However, this date is not listed among the options provided. The closest option to 02/25/1966 is (A) 02/26/1966, but it is not the correct date. Since none of the options match the correct date, there seems to be an error in the options given. The correct date should be 02/25/1966. </pre>

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. So, necessarily, everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) Being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo: If X = frequent-consumer(Dove), then X = owner(Bumble and bumble).

Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap: If X = owner(Bumble and bumble), then X = frequent-consumer(Dove)?

The given premise (1) states that being a frequent consumer of Dove soap is sufficient for being an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo. This means that if someone is a frequent consumer of Dove soap, they must be an owner of Bumble and bumble shampoo. However, it does not state that being an owner of Bumble and bumble shampoo is sufficient or necessary for being a frequent consumer of Dove soap. In other words, the premise only establishes a one-way implication (sufficient condition), not a two-way implication (necessary and sufficient condition).

Therefore, we cannot deduce from the premise that everyone who is an owner of a Bumble and bumble shampoo is a frequent consumer of Dove soap. The argument is invalid because the premise does not support the conclusion.

So the answer is invalid. </pre>

Q: "Some football fans admire various clubs, others love only a single team. But who is a fan of whom precisely? The following argument pertains to this question: To start with, every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach. Now, being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach. Moreover, nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC. All this entails that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) Every opponent to FC Dnipro is an opponent to West Ham United FC or an expert of SCR Altach: If X = opponent(FC Dnipro), then X = opponent(West Ham United FC) OR X = expert(SCR Altach).

(2) Being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for not being an expert of SCR Altach: If X = NOT (expert(SCR Altach)), then X = backer(Chelsea FC).

(3) Nobody is neither an opponent to West Ham United FC nor a backer of Chelsea FC: If X = NOT (opponent(West Ham United FC)), then X = backer(Chelsea FC), and vice versa.

Hypothesis: Does it follow that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro: If X = opponent(FC Dnipro), then X = backer(Chelsea FC)?

Let's see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1), (2), and (3) by logical reasoning:

By (1), if X = opponent(FC Dnipro), then X = opponent(West Ham United FC) OR X = expert(SCR Altach).

If X = opponent(West Ham United FC), then by (3), X = backer(Chelsea FC).

If X = expert(SCR Altach), then by (2), X = NOT (backer(Chelsea FC)). However, this case is not possible because by (3), if X is not a backer of Chelsea FC, then X must be an opponent to West Ham United FC, which contradicts the assumption that X is an expert of SCR Altach.

Therefore, the only possibility is that if X = opponent(FC Dnipro), then X = opponent(West Ham United FC), and by (3), X = backer(Chelsea FC).

So, it is true that being a backer of Chelsea FC is necessary for being an opponent to FC Dnipro. The answer is valid. </pre>

Option (A): "repulsive small Brazilian exercise ship". (1) "repulsive" falls into the opinion category. (2) "small" falls into the size category. (3) "Brazilian" falls into the origin category. (4) "exercise" falls into the purpose category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] [8. purpose] (or, in numeric terms, 1 2 6 8).

Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) massive Congolese cloth smoking surfboard

###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".

Option (A): "massive Congolese cloth smoking surfboard". 
- (1) "massive" falls into the size category.
- (2) "Congolese" falls into the origin category.
- (3) "cloth" could be seen as a material, but in this context, it seems to be a purpose (e.g., a surfboard made for cloth).
- (4) "smoking" is an opinion or descriptive adjective (e.g., cool or stylish).
- The noun is "surfboard".

The adjective order in Option (A) is: [2. size] [6. origin] [7/8. material/purpose] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 2 6 7/8 1). Because 2 &lt; 6 &lt; 7/8 &lt; 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.

Option (B): "cloth smoking massive Congolese surfboard".
- (1) "cloth" as a purpose.
- (2) "smoking" as an opinion.
- (3) "massive" as size.
- (4) "Congolese" as origin.
- The noun is "surfboard".

The adjective order in Option (B) is: [8. purpose] [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] (or, in numeric terms, 8 1 2 6). Because 8 > 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 is not correct, we need to consider the purpose as a material in this context. If we consider "cloth" as a material, the order becomes [7. material] [1. opinion] [2. size] [6. origin] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1 2 6). This order (7 1 2 6) is correct because 7 > 1 &lt; 2 &lt; 6 is not strictly correct, but considering the context, it is the best fit.

Given the context and the order, Option (B) is the closest to correct ordering. So the answer is (B). </pre>

<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a white book, a green book, and an orange book. The green book is to the right of the white book. The orange book is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The white book is the leftmost
(B) The green book is the leftmost
(C) The orange book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of five objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a branch, there are five birds: a falcon, a raven, a cardinal, a hawk, and a crow. The cardinal is the second from the right. The hawk is to the right of the falcon. The raven is the second from the left. The crow is the rightmost.
Options:
(A) The falcon is the leftmost
(B) The raven is the leftmost
(C) The cardinal is the leftmost
(D) The hawk is the leftmost
(E) The crow is the leftmost </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The cardinal is the second from the right: "(left) ? ? ? cardinal ? (right)".
(2) The raven is the second from the left: "(left) raven ? ? ? ? (right)".
(3) The crow is the rightmost: "(left) ? ? ? ? crow (right)".
(4) The hawk is to the right of the falcon: We need to find a place for the falcon and the hawk that satisfies this condition.

Combining (1), (2), and (3), we get: "(left) raven ? ? cardinal crow (right)".

Now, let's place the falcon and the hawk. Since the hawk is to the right of the falcon, and there are only two spots left, the falcon must be in the third position from the left, and the hawk must be in the fourth position from the left. This gives us the final ordering:

"(left) raven falcon hawk cardinal crow (right)".

According to this ordering, the leftmost bird is the raven. So the answer is (B) The raven is the leftmost. </pre>

<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. One day, Alice logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, Zoe also logs in at 9 am. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Zoe cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step. In this scenario, both Alice and Zoe logged into the central computer at the same time, which triggered the empty email to be sent to a non-existent email address. A typical person might consider that since both actions (Alice and Zoe logging in) were required simultaneously to cause the email to be sent, it's not accurate to attribute the cause solely to Zoe. However, since Zoe's action was a necessary part of the event that caused the email to be sent, a typical person might lean towards saying that Zoe contributed to the cause. But because the question asks if Zoe "caused" the email to be sent, and not just contributed, the answer would be more nuanced. A typical person might say "Yes" because Zoe's action was a necessary part of the cause, even though it was not the sole cause. So the answer is Yes, with the understanding that it was a joint cause with Alice's action. </pre>

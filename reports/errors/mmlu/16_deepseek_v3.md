###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to calculate the heat added when one mole of carbon dioxide (CO₂) is heated at constant volume from 540°F to 3540°F. Here's the step-by-step process:

---

### Step 1: Understand the problem
At constant volume, the heat added (\(Q\)) is given by:
\[
Q = n \cdot C_v \cdot \Delta T
\]
where:
- \(n\) = number of moles of gas (1 mole in this case),
- \(C_v\) = molar heat capacity at constant volume,
- \(\Delta T\) = change in temperature.

---

### Step 2: Convert temperatures to Kelvin
The temperatures are given in Fahrenheit, but thermodynamic calculations typically use Kelvin. Convert 540°F and 3540°F to Kelvin:
\[
T(K) = \frac{5}{9} (T(°F) - 32) + 273.15
\]
For 540°F:
\[
T_1 = \frac{5}{9} (540 - 32) + 273.15 = \frac{5}{9} (508) + 273.15 = 282.22 + 273.15 = 555.37 \, K
\]
For 3540°F:
\[
T_2 = \frac{5}{9} (3540 - 32) + 273.15 = \frac{5}{9} (3508) + 273.15 = 1948.89 + 273.15 = 2222.04 \, K
\]
The temperature change (\(\Delta T\)) is:
\[
\Delta T = T_2 - T_1 = 2222.04 - 555.37 = 1666.67 \, K
\]

---

### Step 3: Find the molar heat capacity (\(C_v\)) of CO₂
For CO₂, the molar heat capacity at constant volume (\(C_v\)) is approximately:
\[
C_v = 28.5 \, \text{J/mol·K}
\]
Convert \(C_v\) to Btu/mol·K (1 J = 0.000947817 Btu):
\[
C_v = 28.5 \cdot 0.000947817 = 0.027 \, \text{Btu/mol·K}
\]

---

### Step 4: Calculate the heat added (\(Q\))
Using the formula:
\[
Q = n \cdot C_v \cdot \Delta T
\]
Substitute the values:
\[
Q = 1 \cdot 0.027 \cdot 1666.67 = 45 \, \text{Btu}
\]

---

### Step 5: Match the result to the options
The closest option to 45 Btu is **E) 45,000 Btu**.

In June a computer retailer ordered 100 computers, with various configurations, from a manufacturer, to be delivered by August 1. The order form expressly limited acceptance to the terms of the offer. In July the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications, but stating that "shipment will be made in two deliveries, half by August 10 and the other half by August 20." When shipment was not made by August 1, the retailer withdrew the order. Will the manufacturer prevail in enforcing a contract?

A) No, because the order was withdrawn before the machines were shipped.
B) Yes, because the manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications.
C) Yes, because there was only a minimal difference between the offer and acceptance.
D) No, because the manufacturer failed to deliver on the agreed date.
E) Yes, because the order was not officially canceled by the retailer.
F) No, because the offer expressly limited the acceptance to the terms of the offer.
G) No, because the manufacturer changed the terms without the retailer's explicit consent.
H) Yes, because the retailer assented to the terms by remaining silent until after August 1.
I) Yes, because the manufacturer had the right to change the delivery dates.
J) No, because the retailer has the right to withdraw the order at any time before shipment. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze the situation step by step:

1. **The Offer**: The retailer placed an order for 100 computers, with the express condition that acceptance was limited to the terms of the offer. The delivery date was specified as August 1.

2. **The Acceptance**: The manufacturer sent a confirmation agreeing to the terms and specifications but modified the delivery schedule to "half by August 10 and the other half by August 20."

3. **Key Legal Principle**: Under contract law, an acceptance must mirror the terms of the offer exactly to form a valid contract. If the acceptance includes additional or different terms, it is considered a counteroffer rather than an acceptance.

4. **Analysis**:
   - The manufacturer's confirmation included a change to the delivery schedule, which is a material term of the contract.
   - This change constitutes a counteroffer, not an acceptance.
   - The retailer did not explicitly agree to the counteroffer.
   - The retailer withdrew the order before any shipment was made, which is within their rights since no valid contract was formed.

5. **Conclusion**: The manufacturer cannot enforce the contract because their response was a counteroffer, not an acceptance, and the retailer withdrew the order before any shipment occurred.

suppose sequence x_n satisfies x_n*x_{n+1}=n for all n>=1, and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}=1$. What's the value of $\pi*x_1^2$?

D) 2.5
E) 6.0
F) 5.0
G) 0.5
H) 1.0
I) 3.5
J) 3.0 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, let's analyze the given sequence and the conditions step by step.

### Step 1: Understand the sequence
We are given the sequence \( x_n \) satisfying:
\[
x_n \cdot x_{n+1} = n \quad \text{for all } n \geq 1.
\]
This recurrence relation allows us to express \( x_{n+1} \) in terms of \( x_n \):
\[
x_{n+1} = \frac{n}{x_n}.
\]

### Step 2: Analyze the limit
We are also given:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}} = 1.
\]
Substitute \( x_{n+1} = \frac{n}{x_n} \) into the limit:
\[
\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n}{\frac{n}{x_n}} = \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{x_n^2}{n} = 1.
\]
This implies:
\[
x_n^2 \approx n \quad \text{as } n \to \infty.
\]
Thus, for large \( n \), \( x_n \approx \sqrt{n} \).

### Step 3: Find a general form for \( x_n \)
Assume \( x_n = \sqrt{n} \cdot c_n \), where \( c_n \) is a correction factor that approaches 1 as \( n \to \infty \). Substituting into the recurrence relation:
\[
\sqrt{n} \cdot c_n \cdot \sqrt{n+1} \cdot c_{n+1} = n.
\]
Simplify:
\[
\sqrt{n(n+1)} \cdot c_n c_{n+1} = n.
\]
For large \( n \), \( \sqrt{n(n+1)} \approx n \), so:
\[
n \cdot c_n c_{n+1} \approx n \implies c_n c_{n+1} \approx 1.
\]
Since \( c_n \to 1 \), this is consistent.

### Step 4: Compute \( x_1 \)
Using the recurrence relation for \( n = 1 \):
\[
x_1 \cdot x_2 = 1.
\]
For \( n = 2 \):
\[
x_2 \cdot x_3 = 2.
\]
For \( n = 3 \):
\[
x_3 \cdot x_4 = 3.
\]
Assume \( x_n \approx \sqrt{n} \). Then:
\[
x_1 \approx \sqrt{1} = 1, \quad x_2 \approx \sqrt{2}, \quad x_3 \approx \sqrt{3}, \quad \text{etc.}
\]
From \( x_1 \cdot x_2 = 1 \):
\[
x_1 \cdot \sqrt{2} \approx 1 \implies x_1 \approx \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}.
\]
Thus:
\[
x_1^2 \approx \left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\right)^2 = \frac{1}{2}.
\]

### Step 5: Compute \( \pi \cdot x_1^2 \)
\[
\pi \cdot x_1^2 \approx \pi \cdot \frac{1}{2} = \frac{\pi}{2} \approx 1.57.
\]
The closest option to \( 1.57 \) is \( 1.0 \).

Shot towers were popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for dropping melted lead down tall towers to form spheres for bullets. The lead solidified while falling and often landed in water to cool the lead bullets. Many such shot towers were built in New York State. Assume a shot tower was constructed at latitude $42^{\circ} \mathrm{N}$, and the lead fell a distance of $27 \mathrm{~m}$. In what direction and how far did the lead bullets land from the direct vertical?

A) 1.89 $\mathrm{~mm}$
B) 3.52 $\mathrm{~mm}$
C) 5.14 mm directly south due to Coriolis effect
D) 2.68 $\mathrm{~mm}$

I) 4.73 mm to the East due to Earth's rotation
J) 0.76 mm to the East due to local wind conditions </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to consider the Coriolis effect, which causes a deflection in the path of a falling object due to the Earth's rotation. The Coriolis effect is most significant at higher latitudes and for objects falling from significant heights.

### Step 1: Understand the Coriolis Effect
The Coriolis effect causes a deflection to the right in the Northern Hemisphere. For an object falling vertically, this means it will deflect to the east.

### Step 2: Calculate the Deflection
The formula for the eastward deflection \( d \) due to the Coriolis effect is given by:

\[
d = \frac{2 \Omega h^2 \cos \phi}{g}
\]

Where:
- \( \Omega \) is the angular velocity of the Earth (\( 7.29 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{rad/s} \)),
- \( h \) is the height of the fall (27 m),
- \( \phi \) is the latitude (42°),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (\( 9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2 \)).

### Step 3: Plug in the Values
\[
d = \frac{2 \times 7.29 \times 10^{-5} \times (27)^2 \times \cos(42^\circ)}{9.81}
\]

First, calculate \( \cos(42^\circ) \):
\[
\cos(42^\circ) \approx 0.7431
\]

Now, calculate the deflection:
\[
d = \frac{2 \times 7.29 \times 10^{-5} \times 729 \times 0.7431}{9.81}
\]

\[
d = \frac{2 \times 7.29 \times 10^{-5} \times 729 \times 0.7431}{9.81} \approx 0.0079 \, \text{m} = 7.9 \, \text{mm}
\]

### Step 4: Interpret the Result
The lead bullets will land approximately 7.9 mm to the east of the direct vertical due to the Coriolis effect. However, this value is not among the given options. The closest option is:

I) 4.73 mm to the East due to Earth's rotation

I) The blank form may be mistaken for junk mail and discarded. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's analyze each option step by step:

**A) The auditor may have selected the wrong accounts to send the blank form to.**  
This is not specific to the blank form of confirmation. The selection of accounts is a separate issue and does not directly relate to the effectiveness of the blank form itself.

**B) The blank form might be too complicated for the recipient to understand.**  
The blank form is designed to be simple, as it requires the recipient to fill in the details. This is unlikely to be a significant issue.

**C) Accounts actually confirmed may not be representative of the population.**  
This is a sampling issue, not a problem specific to the blank form of confirmation.

**D) Accounts unconfirmed may have already been written off as uncollectible.**  
This is unrelated to the blank form. It is a general issue with accounts receivable confirmation, regardless of the form used.

**E) The blank form might be lost in the mail, resulting in no response.**  
This is a general risk with any mailed confirmation, not specific to the blank form.

**F) All accounts do not have an equal opportunity to be selected for confirmation.**  
This is a sampling issue, not a problem specific to the blank form.

**G) The recipient may not have the necessary information to fill the blank form.**  
This is a valid concern. The blank form requires the recipient to provide the account balance or other details. If the recipient does not have this information readily available, they may not be able to complete the form, making it ineffective.

**H) Few responses may occur because more effort is required of recipients.**  
This is also a valid concern. The blank form requires more effort from the recipient compared to a standard confirmation form, which may result in fewer responses.

**I) The blank form may be mistaken for junk mail and discarded.**  
This is a general risk with any mailed confirmation, not specific to the blank form.

After analyzing all the options, the most relevant concerns specific to the blank form of positive accounts receivable confirmation are **G** and **H**. However, **G** is the most directly related to the blank form's design and its potential ineffectiveness.

Assume all gases are perfect unless stated otherwise. Note that 1 atm = 1.013 25 bar. Unless otherwise stated, thermochemical data are for 298.15 K. The constant-volume heat capacity of a gas can be measured by observing the decrease in temperature when it expands adiabatically and reversibly. If the decrease in pressure is also measured, we can use it to infer the value of $\gamma=C_p / C_V$ and hence, by combining the two values, deduce the constant-pressure heat capacity. A fluorocarbon gas was allowed to expand reversibly and adiabatically to twice its volume; as a result, the temperature fell from $298.15 \mathrm{~K}$ to $248.44 \mathrm{~K}$ and its pressure fell from $202.94 \mathrm{kPa}$ to $81.840 \mathrm{kPa}$.

###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to determine the constant-pressure heat capacity \( C_p \) of the fluorocarbon gas. We are given the initial and final temperatures, pressures, and the fact that the gas expands adiabatically and reversibly to twice its volume. Here’s the step-by-step solution:

---

### Step 1: Use the adiabatic condition for temperature and volume
For an adiabatic reversible process, the relationship between temperature and volume is:
\[
T_1 V_1^{\gamma-1} = T_2 V_2^{\gamma-1}
\]
where:
- \( T_1 = 298.15 \, \text{K} \) (initial temperature),
- \( T_2 = 248.44 \, \text{K} \) (final temperature),
- \( V_2 = 2V_1 \) (final volume is twice the initial volume),
- \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_V} \) (ratio of heat capacities).

Substitute the values:
\[
298.15 \cdot V_1^{\gamma-1} = 248.44 \cdot (2V_1)^{\gamma-1}
\]
Simplify:
\[
298.15 = 248.44 \cdot 2^{\gamma-1}
\]
\[
\frac{298.15}{248.44} = 2^{\gamma-1}
\]
\[
1.20 = 2^{\gamma-1}
\]
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(1.20) = (\gamma-1) \ln(2)
\]
\[
0.1823 = (\gamma-1) \cdot 0.6931
\]
\[
\gamma - 1 = \frac{0.1823}{0.6931} = 0.263
\]
\[
\gamma = 1.263
\]

---

### Step 2: Use the adiabatic condition for pressure and volume
For an adiabatic reversible process, the relationship between pressure and volume is:
\[
P_1 V_1^\gamma = P_2 V_2^\gamma
\]
where:
- \( P_1 = 202.94 \, \text{kPa} \) (initial pressure),
- \( P_2 = 81.840 \, \text{kPa} \) (final pressure),
- \( V_2 = 2V_1 \) (final volume is twice the initial volume).

Substitute the values:
\[
202.94 \cdot V_1^\gamma = 81.840 \cdot (2V_1)^\gamma
\]
Simplify:
\[
202.94 = 81.840 \cdot 2^\gamma
\]
\[
\frac{202.94}{81.840} = 2^\gamma
\]
\[
2.48 = 2^\gamma
\]
Take the natural logarithm of both sides:
\[
\ln(2.48) = \gamma \ln(2)
\]
\[
0.908 = \gamma \cdot 0.6931
\]
\[
\gamma = \frac{0.908}{0.6931} = 1.31
\]

---

### Step 3: Average the two values of \( \gamma \)
From Step 1, \( \gamma = 1.263 \). From Step 2, \( \gamma = 1.31 \). Take the average:
\[
\gamma = \frac{1.263 + 1.31}{2} = 1.287
\]

---

### Step 4: Relate \( C_p \) and \( C_V \)
The relationship between \( C_p \) and \( C_V \) is:
\[
C_p - C_V = R
\]
where \( R = 8.314 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1} \) is the universal gas constant. Also, \( \gamma = \frac{C_p}{C_V} \).

From \( \gamma = 1.287 \):
\[
C_p = 1.287 C_V
\]
Substitute into \( C_p - C_V = R \):
\[
1.287 C_V - C_V = R
\]
\[
0.287 C_V = R
\]
\[
C_V = \frac{R}{0.287} = \frac{8.314}{0.287} = 28.97 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1}
\]
Now, calculate \( C_p \):
\[
C_p = 1.287 \cdot 28.97 = 37.28 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1}
\]

---

### Step 5: Compare with the given options
The closest option to \( 37.28 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1} \) is:
\[
\text{C) } 38.70 \, \text{J K}^{-1} \text{mol}^{-1}
\]

The graph is undirected, and the edges are:
- &lt;0, 2>
- &lt;2, 1>
- &lt;2, 3>
- &lt;3, 4>
- &lt;4, 1>

This means the connections are:
- Node 0 is connected to Node 2.
- Node 2 is connected to Nodes 1 and 3.
- Node 3 is connected to Node 4.
- Node 4 is connected to Node 1.

### Step 2: Find possible paths from node 4 to node 0
We can explore the paths starting from node 4:

1. **Path 1**: [4, 1, 2, 0]  
   - 4 → 1 (direct connection)  
   - 1 → 2 (direct connection)  
   - 2 → 0 (direct connection)  
   - Length: 3 edges

2. **Path 2**: [4, 3, 2, 0]  
   - 4 → 3 (direct connection)  
   - 3 → 2 (direct connection)  
   - 2 → 0 (direct connection)  
   - Length: 3 edges

3. **Path 3**: [4, 1, 0]  
   - 4 → 1 (direct connection)  
   - 1 → 0 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

4. **Path 4**: [4, 3, 1, 2, 0]  
   - 4 → 3 (direct connection)  
   - 3 → 1 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

5. **Path 5**: [4, 2, 0]  
   - 4 → 2 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

6. **Path 6**: [4, 3, 2, 1, 0]  
   - 4 → 3 (direct connection)  
   - 3 → 2 (direct connection)  
   - 2 → 1 (direct connection)  
   - 1 → 0 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

7. **Path 7**: [4, 1, 3, 2, 0]  
   - 4 → 1 (direct connection)  
   - 1 → 3 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

8. **Path 8**: [4, 3, 0]  
   - 4 → 3 (direct connection)  
   - 3 → 0 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

9. **Path 9**: [4, 2, 3, 1, 0]  
   - 4 → 2 (no direct connection; invalid path)  
   - This path is invalid.

### Step 3: Identify the shortest valid path
The valid paths are:
- [4, 1, 2, 0] (length 3)
- [4, 3, 2, 0] (length 3)

Both paths have the same length, so either is acceptable. However, only one of these options is listed in the choices.

### Step 4: Match the path to the options
The path [4, 3, 2, 0] corresponds to option **C**.

<pre> Answer the following multiple choice question. The last line of your response should be of the following format: 'Answer: $LETTER' (without quotes) where LETTER is one of ABCDEFGHIJ. Think step by step before answering.

An accounting professor has been called as a defense expert witness in a white-collar criminal case. He testified that accounting records conclusively demonstrated that the defendant had not committed any type of fraud. On cross-examination of the professor, the prosecuting attorney asked him if he was familiar with a particular treatise. The professor responded affirmatively. The attorney then asked him if the treatise was accepted as authoritative and if he was aware of the conclusions regarding the ability of accountants to detect fraud. The professor responded in the affirmative. The prosecutor now attempts to read the following section of the treatise into evidence: "It is virtually impossible to state with conclusive certainty the existence, or lack thereof, of fraud in the majority of white-collar crime cases, given the sophistication of defendants and the variety of accounting methods available. "On objection by the defendant's attorney, the trial judge will

A) sustain the objection, because the professor did not rely on the treatise in making his conclusions.
B) sustain the objection, because the statements in the treatise are hearsay not within any recognized exception.
C) overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.
D) sustain the objection, because the prosecutor's question is leading.
E) sustain the objection, because the treatise is not relevant to the professor's testimony.
F) overrule the objection, because the treatise is considered a reliable source in the field of accounting.
G) overrule the objection, because the professor confirmed the treatise's authority.
H) overrule the objection and permit the entire treatise to be introduced into evidence.
I) sustain the objection, because the treatise's statements are opinion-based.
J) overrule the objection and permit only the contradictory statements to be read into evidence. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, let's break it down step by step:

1. **The Scenario**: An accounting professor testified that the defendant did not commit fraud. On cross-examination, the prosecutor asked about a treatise that the professor acknowledged as authoritative. The prosecutor now wants to read a section of the treatise that contradicts the professor's testimony.

2. **Key Legal Principles**:
   - **Hearsay**: Generally, out-of-court statements offered for the truth of the matter asserted are inadmissible unless they fall under an exception.
   - **Learned Treatises**: Under the Federal Rules of Evidence (Rule 803(18)), statements from learned treatises can be admitted into evidence if the treatise is established as a reliable authority and is called to the attention of an expert witness on cross-examination or relied upon by the expert on direct examination.
   - **Relevance**: The treatise must be relevant to the expert's testimony.

3. **Application to the Facts**:
   - The professor acknowledged the treatise as authoritative, which satisfies the requirement for admissibility under Rule 803(18).
   - The treatise's statement directly contradicts the professor's testimony, making it relevant.
   - The prosecutor is not attempting to introduce the entire treatise but only a specific section, which is permissible under the rule.

4. **Analysis of the Options**:
   - **A) Incorrect**: The professor's reliance on the treatise is not required for admissibility under Rule 803(18).
   - **B) Incorrect**: The treatise falls under the learned treatise exception to the hearsay rule.
   - **C) Correct**: The judge will overrule the objection because the treatise is authoritative and relevant, and the prosecutor can ask the professor about it.
   - **D) Incorrect**: The question is not leading; it is about the content of the treatise.
   - **E) Incorrect**: The treatise is relevant because it contradicts the professor's testimony.
   - **F) Incorrect**: While the treatise is reliable, this option does not address the specific issue of reading the section into evidence.
   - **G) Incorrect**: The professor confirmed the treatise's authority, but this option does not fully address the admissibility of the specific section.
   - **H) Incorrect**: The entire treatise cannot be introduced; only the relevant section can be read.
   - **I) Incorrect**: The treatise's statements are not inadmissible simply because they are opinion-based.
   - **J) Incorrect**: The prosecutor is not limited to reading only contradictory statements; the relevant section can be read.

5. **Conclusion**: The judge will overrule the objection and permit the prosecutor to ask the professor about the treatise.

A projectile is fired with an initial speed of $200 \mathrm{~m} / \mathrm{s}$ and angle of elevation $60^{\circ}$. Find the speed at impact.

B) 150 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$

H) 175 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
I) 100 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$
J) 180 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to use the principles of projectile motion. The final speed at impact (also known as the impact velocity) can be found using the conservation of energy or the equations of motion for projectile motion. However, since the initial speed is given and we are not dealing with a gravitational acceleration component that would change over time (as the projectile is not moving in a parabolic path), we can use the fact that the initial and final speeds in the direction of the elevation angle will be the same because the horizontal component of the velocity remains constant.

Given:
- Initial speed, $v_0 = 200 \mathrm{m/s}$
- Angle of elevation, $\theta = 60^{\circ}$

The final speed at impact, $v_f$, will be the same as the initial speed in the direction of the elevation angle because there is no acceleration in the direction of the elevation angle due to the absence of gravity in this context. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: D) 200 $\mathrm{m}/\mathrm{s}$ </pre>

Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days to feed his cats. Approximately how many boxes of cat food does he use per month?

A) 2 boxes
B) 1 box
C) 4 boxes
D) 5 boxes
E) 10 boxes
F) 8 boxes
G) 6 boxes
H) 3 boxes
I) 12 boxes
J) 7 boxes </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, we need to calculate how many 5-day periods there are in a month and then multiply that by the number of boxes Rob uses per period.

A month is typically considered to have about 30 or 31 days, depending on whether it's a leap year or not. Since Rob uses 1 box of cat food every 5 days, we can calculate the number of boxes used per month as follows:

1. Determine the number of 5-day periods in a month.
2. Multiply that number by the number of boxes used per period.

Let's do the math:

1. For a non-leap year month (30 days):
   - Number of 5-day periods = 30 days / 5 days/box = 6 boxes

2. For a leap year month (31 days):
   - Number of 5-day periods = 31 days / 5 days/box = 6 boxes (with a remainder, so we'll round down to 6 boxes for the full month)

Now, let's look at the options provided and see which one matches our calculation:

A) 2 boxes
B) 1 box
C) 4 boxes
D) 5 boxes
E) 10 boxes
F) 8 boxes
G) 6 boxes
H) 3 boxes

Based on our calculation, the closest option is:

Answer: D) 5 boxes

This is because a non-leap year month has 6 full 5-day periods, and since Rob uses 1 box per period, he would use 6 boxes in a non-leap year month. A leap year month also results in 6 boxes, but since we are looking for the approximate number of boxes used per month, we can consider the average of the two options provided. </pre>

Why are slight differences in growth rate percentages so important?

A) They represent the country's GDP
B) They are directly correlated with changes in national education levels
C) They are indicative of immediate changes in consumer confidence
D) They indicate the rate of technological innovation
E) They indicate economic stability
F) They show population change
G) They determine the exact size of the workforce
H) They signify shifts in currency exchange rates
I) They measure the precise impact of foreign investment
J) They can reflect large differences in potential output </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Answer: J) They can reflect large differences in potential output

Explanation:
Growth rate percentages are important because they provide insights into the economic health and potential of a country. They can indicate the rate of technological innovation, shifts in consumer confidence, and the stability of an economy, among other factors. However, the most direct way they can reflect differences in potential output is by showing how quickly a country's economy is expanding or contracting. This expansion or contraction can lead to significant changes in the labor market, investment opportunities, and overall economic performance, which in turn can affect a country's potential output. Therefore, option J is the most accurate answer. </pre>

Liquid nitrogen is an excellent bath for keeping temperatures around 77°K, its normal boiling point. What pressure would you need to maintain over the liquid nitrogen if you wanted to set the bath temperature at 85°K? Heat of vaporization is about 5560 (J / mole).

A) 3.0 atm
B) 1.0 atm
C) 2.26 atm
D) 1.5 atm
E) 5.5 atm
F) 6.0 atm
G) 4.0 atm
H) 2.5 atm
I) 3.5 atm
J) 2.0 atm </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the boiling point of a substance and the pressure required to maintain that temperature. The boiling point of a liquid decreases as the pressure increases. This is because the added pressure pushes the liquid molecules closer together, reducing the distance over which they can escape into the vapor phase, thus lowering the boiling point.

The formula that relates the boiling point (Tb) to the pressure (P) is given by:

\[ T_b = \frac{P \cdot L} {P + L} \]

where L is the latent heat of vaporization of the substance.

Given:
- The normal boiling point of liquid nitrogen (Tb) is 77°K.
- We want to set the bath temperature at 85°K.
- The heat of vaporization (L) is 5560 J/mol.

We need to find the pressure (P) that would be required to maintain the bath temperature at 85°K.

Let's denote the pressure we need to find as P. We can rearrange the formula to solve for P:

\[ P = \frac{L \cdot (T_b + T_{desired})}{T_{desired} - T_b} \]

Plugging in the values:

\[ P = \frac{5560 \cdot (77 + 85)}{85 - 77} \]
\[ P = \frac{5560 \cdot 162}{8} \]
\[ P = \frac{894720}{8} \]
\[ P = 111840 \text{ J/mol} \]

Now, we need to convert this energy into pressure using the ideal gas law, PV = nRT, where R is the ideal gas constant (8.314 J/(mol·K)):

\[ P = \frac{nRT}{V} \]

Since we are looking for the pressure in atmospheres (atm), we need to convert the energy from joules to energy in terms of a standard volume. However, in this case, we are not given the volume, so we will assume that the energy is converted into a volume of liquid nitrogen that would result in the desired temperature. The volume of liquid nitrogen required can be calculated using the molar volume of a gas at standard temperature and pressure (STP), which is 22.4 L/mol. However, since we are not given the volume, we will use the fact that the pressure is directly related to the temperature change.

Given the options, we can see that the pressure required to lower the boiling point of liquid nitrogen from 77°K to 85°K is not a simple multiple of the given options. However, we can infer that the pressure required is not a constant value but rather depends on the temperature change. The closest option to the calculated pressure is:

Answer: C) 2.26 atm

This is a rough estimate based on the fact that the pressure required to lower the boiling point of a substance is not a simple linear function of the temperature change. The exact calculation would require a more detailed understanding of the phase behavior of liquid nitrogen and the specific volume changes that occur with temperature changes. </pre>

A 54-year-old man comes to the physician because of episodes of fainting for 3 months. He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?

A) First-degree atrioventricular block
B) Sinus bradycardia
C) Left bundle branch block
D) Myocardial infarction
E) Third-degree atrioventricular block
F) Supraventricular tachycardia
G) Ventricular fibrillation
H) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I
I) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type II
J) Right bundle branch block </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Answer: E) Third-degree atrioventricular block

**Explanation:**

The patient's ECG findings are indicative of a third-degree atrioventricular block. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the ECG findings that support this diagnosis:

1. **Pace-Setting (P-wave):** The P-wave rate is 90/min, which is much slower than the heart rate of 40/min on the R-wave. This indicates that the atria are not being effectively triggered to contract by the AV node.

2. **R-wave Rate:** The R-wave rate is 40/min, which is significantly slower than the P-wave rate. This is consistent with the P-wave being the only rate-modulating factor in the ECG.

3. **No Apparent Relation:** There is no apparent relationship between the P-wave and R-wave rates, which is characteristic of a third-degree AV block.

The other options provided do not match the ECG findings:

- A) First-degree atrioventricular block: This would show a P-wave that is not synchronized with the QRS complex, but the rate of the P-wave is not slower than the R-wave.
- B) Sinus bradycardia: This would show a slow heart rate but would not have a P-wave.
- C) Left bundle branch block: This would show a consistent relationship between the P-wave and R-wave rates.
- D) Myocardial infarction: This is a clinical diagnosis and not supported by the ECG findings.
- E) Third-degree atrioventricular block: This is supported by the P-wave rate being much slower than the R-wave rate.
- F) Supraventricular tachycardia: This would show a fast heart rate with a normal P-wave rate.
- G) Ventricular fibrillation: This is a life-threatening arrhythmia and is not supported by the ECG findings.
- H) Second-degree atrioventricular block, type I: This would show a relationship between the P-wave and R-wave rates, but the P-wave rate is not slower than the R-wave rate.

Therefore, the most likely diagnosis based on the ECG findings is a third-degree atrioventricular block. </pre>

A typewriter is priced at $80, less series discounts of 20%, 10%, 5%. What is the net price?

A) $58.40
B) $50.00
C) $56.00
D) $62.40
E) $60.00
F) $54.72
G) $65.00
H) $46.08
I) $48.00
J) $52.00 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the net price of the typewriter after applying the series of discounts, we need to apply each discount sequentially. The discounts are 20%, 10%, and 5%. Let's calculate the net price step by step.

### Step 1: Apply the 20% Discount
The original price of the typewriter is $80. A 20% discount means the customer pays 80% of the original price.

Discount Amount = 20% of $80 = 0.20 * $80 = $16

### Step 2: Apply the 10% Discount
Now, we apply the second discount of 10% to the reduced price after the first discount.

Discount Amount = 10% of ($80 - $16) = 0.10 * $64 = $6.40

### Step 3: Apply the 5% Discount
Finally, we apply the last discount of 5% to the price after the second discount.

Discount Amount = 5% of ($64 - $6.40) = 0.05 * $57.60 = $2.88

### Step 4: Calculate the Net Price
Subtract the total discount from the original price to get the net price.

Net Price = $80 - ($16 + $6.40 + $2.88) = $80 - $25.28 = $54.72

### Answer:
The net price of the typewriter after applying all the discounts is $54.72. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Answer: F) $54.72 </pre>

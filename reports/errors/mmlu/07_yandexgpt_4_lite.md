A gravity fed lock in a proposed shipping canal is to be studied with a 1/100-scale geometrically similar model. (a) If the model lock fills in 0.8 min, estimate the time for the prototype to fill. (b) Find the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype locks.

A) 5 min, \(\lambda^7/2\)
B) 9 min, \lambda^3/2
C) 11 min, \(\lambda^4\)
D) 12 min, \(\lambda^5/3\)
E) 7 min, \lambda^4/2
F) 6 min, \lambda^6/2
G) 8 min, \lambda^5/2
H) 4 min, \(\lambda^2\)
I) 10 min, \(\lambda^3\)
J) 15 min, \(\lambda^7/3\) </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To find the time for the prototype to fill, we can use the concept of geometric similarity. Since the model lock fills in 0.8 minutes, we can scale up the time proportionally to the scale factor of 1/100.

So, the time for the prototype to fill would be:

Time for prototype = (Time for model) * (Scale factor)^2

Time for prototype = 0.8 min * (1/100)^2 = 0.8 * (1/100) * (1/100) = 0.8 / (100 * 100) = 0.8 / 10000 = 0.00008 min

Simplifying, the time for the prototype to fill is 0.00008 minutes.

To find the ratio of corresponding mass flow rates in the model and prototype locks, we need to consider the square of the scale factor, as it affects both dimensions and volumes. However, the question does not provide specific information on how the mass flow rate is related to the dimensions or volumes in the problem. Without that information, it is not possible to determine the exact ratio of mass flow rates.

Statement 1| Since the VC dimension for an SVM with a Radial Base Kernel is infinite, such an SVM must be worse than an SVM with polynomial kernel which has a finite VC dimension. Statement 2| A two layer neural network with linear activation functions is essentially a weighted combination of linear separators, trained on a given dataset; the boosting algorithm built on linear separators also finds a combination of linear separators, therefore these two algorithms will give the same result.

A) False, False
B) False, True
C) Neither True nor False, False
D) Neither True nor False, True
E) True, True
F) False, Neither True nor False
G) Neither True nor False, Neither True nor False
H) True, False
I) True, Neither True nor False
J) True, False and False, True </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Statement 1 suggests that an SVM with a Radial Base Kernel is worse than an SVM with a polynomial kernel. However, this does not necessarily mean that the first SVM is worse in general, as the performance of an algorithm depends on various factors. Therefore, Statement 1 is neither true nor false.

Statement 2 states that a two-layer neural network with linear activation functions and the boosting algorithm built on linear separators give the same result. This statement is true, as both algorithms essentially find a combination of linear separators.

Based on the above analysis, the correct answer is E) True, True.

Shot towers were popular in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries for dropping melted lead down tall towers to form spheres for bullets. The lead solidified while falling and often landed in water to cool the lead bullets. Many such shot towers were built in New York State.

In what direction and how far did the lead bullets land from the direct vertical?

Interestingly, none of the civilizations of ancient South America appear to have developed:

A) advanced metallurgy.
B) monumental works.
C) a system of money.
D) maritime navigation technology.
E) complex religious systems.
F) irrigation technology.
G) a written language. </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To answer this question, we need to consider the specific aspects of ancient South American civilizations. Advanced metallurgy, monumental works, and complex religious systems were developed by some of these civilizations, but others did not develop certain technologies or systems.

Considering the options, it seems that the most appropriate answer is D) maritime navigation technology. While some civilizations in ancient South America did develop advanced technologies and systems, there is no clear evidence that they had developed maritime navigation technology to the same extent as other civilizations around the world.

Calculate the heat added when one mole of carbon dioxide is heated at constant volume from 540 to 3540 F.

G) 55,000 Btu
H) 60,000 Btu
I) 20,000 Btu
J) 50,000 Btu </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the heat added, we need to know the specific heat capacity of carbon dioxide. Unfortunately, without this information, we cannot provide an accurate answer. However, we can make some general observations.

The specific heat capacity of a substance is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of 1 kg of the substance by 1 K. It varies depending on the temperature and phase of the substance.

Assuming we have the specific heat capacity of carbon dioxide, we can use the formula:

$Q = n * C_p * ΔT$,

where:
- Q is the heat added,
- n is the number of moles of carbon dioxide,
- C_p is the specific heat capacity of carbon dioxide,
- ΔT is the temperature difference.

Substituting the given values, we can calculate the heat added.

suppose sequence x_n satisfies x_n*x_{n+1}=n for all n>=1, and $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}=1$. What's the value of $\pi*x_1^2$?

A) 3.14
B) 2.0
C) 4.0
D) 2.5
E) 6.0
F) 5.0
G) 0.5
H) 1.0
I) 3.5
J) 3.0 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> We know that $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}=1$, which means that the sequence $\frac{x_n}{x_{n+1}}$ is bounded. Since the sequence satisfies $x_n*x_{n+1}=n$ for all $n\geq1$, we can see that $x_n$ and $x_{n+1}$ have the same sign for each $n$.

Let's consider the ratio of consecutive terms:

$\frac{x_{n+2}}{x_{n+1}} = \frac{n+3}{n+4}$

Since the limit of the ratio is 1, we can conclude that the ratios tend to 1 as $n$ tends to infinity. This implies that the absolute values of the terms tend to a constant value.

To find the value of $\pi*x_1^2$, we need more information about the sequence or its behavior at $n=1$. Without that, we cannot determine the exact value of $\pi*x_1^2$.

2,300 volt60-cycle power transformer. r_1 = 1.28 ohmsr_2 = 0.0467 ohm x_1= 4.24 ohmsx_2 = 0.162 ohm Calculate the regulation using the per-unit method.

F) 2.5 per cent
G) 2.0 per cent
H) 1.85 per cent
I) 1.4 per cent
J) 1.66 per cent </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To calculate the regulation using the per-unit method, we need to determine the percentage change in output voltage for a given percentage change in input voltage.

The regulation can be calculated using the formula:

Regulation = (ΔV / V) * 100%,

where ΔV is the change in output voltage and V is the nominal output voltage.

Let's calculate the regulation for each component separately and then combine the results.

For r_1 = 1.28 ohms and x_1 = 4.24 ohms, we can calculate the change in voltage using Ohm's law:

ΔV_1 = I * (r_1 + x_1),

where I is the current flowing through the transformer.

Similarly, for r_2 = 0.0467 ohm and x_2 = 0.162 ohm, we can calculate the change in voltage:

ΔV_2 = I * (r_2 + x_2).

The total regulation can be calculated by combining the changes in voltage for each component:

Regulation = ((ΔV_1 + ΔV_2) / V) * 100%.

Without specific values for the current I, it is not possible to provide an exact answer. However, based on the given information, we can conclude that the regulation using the per-unit method is approximately 1.4 per cent.

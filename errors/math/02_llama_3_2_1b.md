Compute $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right).$  Express your answer in radians.

###### answer
<pre> Since $-\frac{1}{2}$ is negative, we know that $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)$ is in the third or fourth quadrant. We can use the fact that $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$ to find the value of $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)$. Since $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$, we have that $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{\pi}{6}.$

Answer: $\frac{\pi}{6}$ </pre>

Find all values of $x$ that satisfy the equation $x = \!\sqrt{11-2x} + 4$.

Remember to put your answer on its own line after "Answer:", and you do not need to use a \boxed command </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve the equation, we start by isolating the square root term on one side of the equation.

First, we subtract 4 from both sides of the equation to get:

x - 4 = √(11 - 2x)

Next, we square both sides of the equation to eliminate the square root:

(x - 4)^2 = 11 - 2x

Expanding the left side of the equation gives:

x^2 - 8x + 16 = 11 - 2x

Now, we bring all terms to one side of the equation to set it equal to zero:

x^2 - 8x + 16 - 11 + 2x = 0

Combine like terms:

x^2 - 6x + 5 = 0

We can factor the quadratic equation:

(x - 5)(x - 1) = 0

This gives us two possible solutions for x:

x - 5 = 0 or x - 1 = 0

Solving for x in both equations gives:

x = 5 or x = 1

Therefore, the values of x that satisfy the equation are x = 5 and x = 1. </pre>

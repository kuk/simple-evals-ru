Q: Which sentence has the correct adjective order:
Options:
(A) rubber terrible ship
(B) terrible rubber ship
A: Let's think step by step.
When there is more than one adjective before a noun, the adjectives need to respect the following order before a noun: "[1. opinion] [2. size] [3. age] [4. shape] [5. color] [6. origin] [7. material] [8. purpose] noun".
Option (A): "rubber terrible ship". (1) rubber" falls into the material category. (2) "terrible" falls into the opinion category. Option (A) has the following adjective order: [7. material] [1. opinion] (or, in numeric terms, 7 1). Because 7 &lt; 1 is not correct, (A) does not have the correct ordering.
Option (B): "terrible rubber ship". Option (B) has the following adjective order: [1. opinion] [7. material] (or, in numeric terms, 1 7). Because 1 &lt; 7 is correct, (B) has the correct ordering. So the answer is (B).

###### instruction
<pre> Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
Now, we add James to this table: James is 12 years old.
The penguins that are less than 8 years old are Louis and Bernard.
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  Which is the youngest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on age. We know the following: Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.
According to the table, Bernard (5) is the youngest amongst them.
The youngest penguin is Bernard. So the answer is (B).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.  What is the name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
A: Let's think step by step.
This question focuses on the name. We know the following: The names of the penguin in the table are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen.
When we sort their names alphabetically, we get Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetical order is Gwen.
The name of the second penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Gwen. So the answer is (D).

Q: Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:  name, age, height (cm), weight (kg) Louis, 7, 50, 11 Bernard, 5, 80, 13 Vincent, 9, 60, 11 Gwen, 8, 70, 15  For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Whistleblowers are great, heroes, they're in the public interest. They're accusing one of us? Back them up
(B) Whistleblowers are great, heroes, they're in the public interest. They're accusing one of us? Lock them up </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let’s think step by step.
If we look at (A), it encourages backing up whistleblowers, implying that they are doing the right thing.
If we look at (B), it suggests locking up whistleblowers, implying that their actions are wrong. The contrast between the positive tone in (A) and the negative tone in (B) suggests that (B) is sarcastic.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B). </pre>

###### answer
<pre> Let’s think step by step.
If we look at (A), it suggests that it is not the responsibility of individuals or organizations to fund education, implying that the government should take on this responsibility. This is a reasonable and valid statement.
If we look at (B), it suggests that it is not the responsibility of individuals or organizations to fund education, and instead proposes that children should be responsible for funding schools. This is clearly absurd and sarcastic, as it places the financial burden of education on children who are typically not in a position to do so.

### formal_fallacies/183
###### instruction
<pre> Distinguish deductively valid arguments from formal fallacies.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: To begin with, Lesley is a close friend of Fernando. Moreover, being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy. It follows that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Lesley is a close friend of Fernando: Lesley = friend(Fernando).
(2) Being a close friend of Fernando or a schoolmate of Lowell is sufficient for being a great-grandfather of Leroy: If X = friend(Fernando) OR SCHOOLMATE(Lowell), then X = great-grandfather(Leroy).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy: Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have Lesley = friend(Fernando). By (2), we have if Lesley = friend(Fernando), then Lesley = great-grandfather(Leroy).
So, it is true that Lesley is a great-grandfather of Leroy. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to see who is related to whom -- and in which ways. The following argument pertains to this question: Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian. Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde. We may conclude: Everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Whoever is not a great-grandfather of Clyde is a stepbrother of Brian: If X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
(2): Being an ancestor of Dana is sufficient for not being a great-grandfather of Clyde: If X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian, too: If X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian)?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (2), we have if X = ancestor(Dana), X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)).
Furthermore, by (1), we have if X = NOT (great-grandfather(Clyde)), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
By the transitive relation rule in first-order logic, we then have: if X = ancestor(Dana), then X = stepbrother(Brian).
So, it is true that everyone who is an ancestor of Dana is a stepbrother of Brian. So the answer is valid.

Q: "It is not always easy to grasp who is consuming which products. The following argument pertains to this question: Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both. No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and, in the same time, a loyal buyer of Caress soap. It follows that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid
- invalid
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Every infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is either a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo or a loyal buyer of Caress soap, or both: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress).
(2): No regular consumer of Lush soap is a rare consumer of Nioxin shampoo and a loyal buyer of Caress soap at the same time. If X = regular-consumer(Lush), then X = NOT (rare-consumer(Nioxin) AND loyal-buyer(Caress)).
Hypothesis: Does it follow that whoever is an infrequent user of Paul Mitchell shampoo is not a regular consumer of Lush soap: If X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = NOT (regular-consumer(Lush))?
Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1) and (2) by logical reasoning?
By (1), we have if X = infrequent-user(Paul Mitchell), then X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) OR X = loyal-buyer(Caress). We need to consider both cases separately:
The case X = rare-consumer(Nioxin) does not appear in (2).
The case X = loyal-buyer(Caress) does not appear in (2), either.
So, from (1) and (2), we cannot necessarily deduce the Hypothesis. So the answer is invalid.

Q: "Consumer research aims at understanding whether users of some products also tend to consume other ones, or not. The following argument seeks to clarify some such relations: To begin with, it is false that Loren is an infrequent user of Olay soap. Moreover, Loren is not a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo. Finally, every regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo or an infrequent user of Olay soap. It follows that Loren is not a regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap."
Is the argument, given the explicitly stated premises, deductively valid or invalid?
Options:
- valid 
- invalid </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) It is false that Loren is an infrequent user of Olay soap.
(2) Loren is not a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo.
(3) Every regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo or an infrequent user of Olay soap.

Hypothesis: Does it follow that Loren is not a regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap: If X = Loren, then X is not a regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap?

Let’s see whether the Hypothesis can be deduced from the arguments (1), (2) and (3) by logical reasoning.

By (1), we know that Loren is not an infrequent user of Olay soap.
By (2), we know that Loren is not a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo.
By (3), we know that every regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap is a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo or an infrequent user of Olay soap.

Since Loren is not a frequent consumer of Garnier shampoo and is not an infrequent user of Olay soap, Loren does not meet the criteria for being a regular consumer of Tom's of Maine soap.

So, the answer is valid. </pre>

###### instruction
<pre> Given a series of navigation instructions, determine whether one would end up back at the starting point.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn left. Turn around. Turn left. Take 7 steps. Take 2 steps. Take 4 steps. Take 8 steps.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the negative x-axis.
(2) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the positive x-axis.
(3) Turn left: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 2 steps: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 4 steps: (0, 13), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 8 steps: (0, 21), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 21) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Turn around. Take 1 step. Take 6 steps. Turn around. Take 6 steps. Take 9 steps. Take 1 step.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (0, -1), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (0, -7), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Turn around: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (0, -1), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (0, 8), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Take 7 steps right.
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Take 7 steps. Take 8 steps. Take 10 steps. Turn around. Turn around. Take 5 steps. Turn around.
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
We start at the origin (0, 0).
(1) Take 7 steps: (0, 7).
(2) Take 8 steps: (0, 15).
(3) Take 10 steps: (0, 25).
(4) Turn around: (0, 25), facing the negative x-axis.
(5) Turn around: (0, 25), facing the positive x-axis again.
(6) Take 5 steps: (0, 30).
Since (0, 30) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No. </pre>

### snarks/75
###### instruction
<pre> Determine which of two sentences is sarcastic.

According to Cambridge University Dictionary, sarcasm is "the use of remarks that clearly mean the opposite of what they say, made in order to hurt someone's feelings or to criticize something in a humorous way." Sarcastic sentences often contain satirical or ironic utterances, hyperboles, ambivalent or witty remarks.

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste
(B) Yes, because having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge waste, implying that it is a useless effort. However, we know that having interests and actively researching them is typically not a waste but rather is beneficial to the individual. The presence of such a juxtaposition in (A) suggests that it contains a taste of irony and sarcasm.
If we look at (B), it says that having interests and actively researching them is a huge deal, implying that it is an important and consequential effort. This is arguably a neutral and correct statement.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case
(B) No one is going to disagree with you on this. Ad hominem attacks really help your case
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it says that avoiding ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are adverse and injurious. Because ad hominem attacks are adressed at a person rather than an idea, it is indeed true that avoiding them is often useful and helpful; so, (A) is a neutral (valid and agreeable) statement.
If we look at (B), it says that ad hominem attacks really help your case, implying that ad hominem attacks are a positive thing. However, we stated previously that ad hominem attacks are often not useful or constructive. The speaker in this sentence therefore seems to mean the opposite of what they are saying; so, there appears to have a taste of irony and sarcasm in (B).
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, politics?
(B) Consistency in the league's punishments? What do you think this is supposed to be, moral?
A: Let's think step by step.
If we look at (A), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in politics. Because politics or political affairs are often not considered to be consistent or dependable, this sentence appears to be satirical.
If we look at (B), it likens the consistency in the league's punishments with that in morality. Discussing the consistency of the league's punishments in the context of morality, ethics, or law makes sense and does not appear to make a satirical point about anything.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which statement is sarcastic?
Options:
(A) And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....zero
(B) And the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely,....high </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let’s think step by step.
If we look at (A), it expresses the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely as zero, implying that such events are extremely unlikely. However, given the increasing number of cyberattacks and the vulnerabilities of connected devices, claiming zero likelihood seems highly unlikely and sarcastic.
If we look at (B), it expresses the likelihood of internet-connected cars being hacked and controlled remotely as high, implying that such events are quite possible. This statement contradicts the common knowledge of cybersecurity risks and seems sarcastic due to the incongruence between the stated likelihood and the actual risk level.
Above the above, the sarcastic option is (A). So the answer is (A). </pre>

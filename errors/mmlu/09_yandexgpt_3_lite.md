Two atoms of scandium are to combine with three atoms of oxygen. If you start with 1 gram of scandium, how much oxygen is required? Scandium has an atomic weight of 44.96 g/mole. The at. wt. of oxygen is 15.999 g/mole.

A) 0.400 g of oxygen
B) 0.800 g of oxygen
C) .444 g of oxygen
D) .623 g of oxygen
E) 0.711 g of oxygen
F) 0.360 g of oxygen
G) 0.250 g of oxygen
H) 0.675 g of oxygen
I) .290 g of oxygen
J) .533 g of oxygen </pre>
###### answer
<pre> **Answer: D**

First, we need to find the molar ratio of scandium and oxygen atoms in the reaction. The mole ratio is determined by the coefficients in the balanced chemical equation for the reaction:

$2 \text{ Sc} + 3 \text{ O}_2 \rightarrow 2 \text{ ScO}_3$

From the equation, we see that two moles of scandium react with three moles of oxygen to produce two moles of ScO$_3$.

Now we can calculate the number of moles of each element in the given amount of scandium.

Moles of scandium = mass / atomic weight = 1 g / 44.96 g/mol = 0.0224 mol

Since two moles of scandium reacts with three moles of oxygen, we know that 0.0224 moles of scandium requires (3/2) * 0.0224 = 0.0336 moles of oxygen.

Finally, we can find the mass of oxygen required by multiplying the number of moles by the atomic weight of oxygen:

Mass of oxygen = moles * atomic weight = 0.0336 mol * 15.999 g/mol ≈ 0.533 g

An oscillator which emits high frequency waves at 0.26 GHz is set up in front of a large plane metal reflector. Standing waves are formed with nodes 57.5 cm apart. Neglecting the refractive index of air, compute the velocity of light.

A) 5.98 × 10^10 cm/sec
B) 3.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
C) 3.00 × 10^10 cm/sec
D) 2.99 × 10^11 cm/sec
E) 2.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
F) 2.99 × 10^9 cm/sec
G) 1.49 × 10^10 cm/sec
H) 1.99 × 10^11 cm/sec
I) 1.99 × 10^10 cm/sec
J) 4.99 × 10^10 cm/sec </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Answer: **C**

The wavelength of the standing wave is given by $\lambda = 2L$, where L is the distance between the nodes. The velocity of light is then given by $v = f \cdot \lambda$, where f is the frequency of the waves. Substituting the given values, we get:

$v = (0.26 \text{ GHz}) \cdot (57.5 \text{ cm}) = 15.05 \cdot 10^8 \text{cm/s}$

Since the velocity of light in a vacuum is approximately $3 \cdot 10^{10} \text{ cm/s}$, we can divide by this value to get the velocity of light:

$\frac{v}{3 \cdot 10^{10}} = \frac{15.05 \cdot 10^8}{30000000} = 5.02 \approx 5$

Therefore, the velocity of light $v \approx 3 \cdot 10^{10}$ cm/s, which is close to the value for vacuum light.

Thus, the correct answer is **C**. </pre>

<pre> **Answer: C**

При $x \to 1$ знаменатель $(x - 1)$ стремится к нулю, поэтому выражение $1/(x - 1)$, стремящееся к бесконечности, не позволяет определить предел.

Чтобы определить предел выражения, нужно рассмотреть поведение второго слагаемого. При $x \to 1$, знаменатель $x^3 - 1 = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$ не равен нулю, значит, предел этого слагаемого существует.

$\lim_{x \to 1}c/(x^3-1) = c/0$ — неопределённость вида $0/0$. Чтобы раскрыть эту неопределённость, нужно преобразовать выражение так, чтобы сократить на ноль. Для этого домножим на сопряжённое выражение $(x^3 – 1)/(x^3–1)$:

$c/(x-1)\cdot(x^3−1)/(x−1)=c/(x−1)$.

Таким образом, предел выражения зависит от значения $c$.

Если $c=0$, то предел равен бесконечности. Если $c>0$, то выражение стремится к бесконечности при $x\to1$. Если $c<0$, то при $x=1$ выражение не определено, а при $x>1$ стремится к $-\infty$.

Suppose that in the base year, GNP = $1000 billion. Since the base year, money GNP has increased $500 billion while real GNP has increased $250 billion. What is the current price index?

A) 100
B) 140
C) 150
D) 130
E) 120
F) 180
G) 110
H) 200
I) 250
J) 160 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Answer: **C**

To find the current price index, we need to divide the current GNP by the base year GNP and then multiply by 100.

Current GNP = $1000 + 500 = 1500 billion
Real GNP = 1000 + 250 = 1250 billion

Price index = (1500 / 1000) * 100 = 1.5 * 100 = **150**

Thus, the correct answer is **C**. </pre>

A student was a practical joker who liked to perform zany antics. Late at night after studying, he would often walk around the campus dressed only in a raincoat and boxers. As he approached young women, he would flash them by opening his raincoat and exposing himself in his shorts. The student believed that he was committing a crime by flashing himself in front of the co-eds. In this jurisdiction, it is a felony to flash or expose oneself in the nude, so, unknown to the student, what he was doing was not a crime. One night, the student broke into a sorority house intending to flash the sorority sisters. Clad only in his raincoat and shorts, he entered the bedroom of one of the sisters who was lying in her bed studying for an exam. The sister, who knew the student, said, "What are you doing here? Shouldn't you be studying for finals?" The student then took off his raincoat and responded, "Study this, baby!" He then began to run through the sorority house in his shorts. Shortly thereafter, the police arrived and placed the student under arrest. If the student is prosecuted, he should be found guilty of which, if any, of the following crimes?

A) Neither burglary nor attempted violation of the statute.
B) Attempted violation of the statute.
C) Both indecent exposure and attempted violation of the statute.

A 19-year-old college student comes to the physician because of vaginal irritation and pain with urination for 5 days. Two weeks ago, she had streptococcal pharyngitis treated with amoxicillin. She has been sexually active with two partners over the past year; she uses condoms for contraception. Her last menstrual period was 1 week ago. Her temperature is 37.2°C (99°F), and blood pressure is 90/60 mm Hg. Pelvic examination shows erythema of the vulva and vagina and a thick white vaginal discharge. The pH of the discharge is 4. Which of the following is the most likely cause of these findings?

A) Bacterial vaginosis
B) Candidiasis
C) Chlamydia trachomatis infection
D) Escherichia coli infection </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Answer: **C**

This patient has symptoms of vaginal irritation and pain with urination, which can be indicative of an infection. She had streptococcal pharyngitis two weeks ago, which is a bacterial infection of the throat. Antibiotics, such as amoxicillin, are used to treat this type of infection. While antibiotics can disrupt the balance of bacteria in the vagina, they do not typically cause vaginal infections.

Bacterial vaginosis is characterized by a change in the normal balance of bacteria in the vaginal flora, often associated with a fishy odor and a thin, grayish discharge. Candidiasis, or yeast infection, is caused by an overgrowth of Candida albicans and often results in itching, burning, and a thick, white discharge. Chlamydia trachomatis is a sexually transmitted infection that can cause pelvic inflammatory disease and is often asymptomatic. Escherichia coli is a type of bacteria commonly found in the intestines but can also cause urinary tract infections.

Based on the description, chlamydia trachomatis infection is the most likely cause of these findings. However, more information is needed to make a definitive diagnosis. Pelvic examination and laboratory testing, such as a culture or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, are necessary to identify the specific cause of the infection. </pre>

Чтобы решить задачу, нужно найти потенциальную энергию взаимодействия ионов калия и иода, которая равна $E_P = k \frac{e^2}{d}$, где $k$ — постоянная Кулона, $e$ — заряд электрона, $d$ — расстояние между ионами.

В задаче дано, что $R = 3.04 \cdot 10^{-10}$ м, $K = 9 \cdot 10^9$ $\frac{Н \cdot м^2}{Кл^2}$, $Z_K = +1$, $Z_I = -1$. Нужно найти энергию, необходимую для разделения атомов в молекуле $KI$.

Заряд электрона $e = 1.6 \cdot 10^{-19}$ Кл.

Подставим известные значения в формулу потенциальной энергии:

$E_P= \frac{9 \cdot10^9 \cdot (1,6 \cdot10^{-19})^2}{3,04 \cdot10^{-10}} = 7,1 \cdot 10^{-15}$ Дж.

Переведём энергию в электрон-вольты:

7,1 $\cdot 10^{-15} \cdot 1,602 \cdot 10^{-19} = 8,4 \cdot 10^{-7}$ эВ.

###### answer
<pre> Answer: **D**

To calculate the ratio of energy loss when a 4 MeV alpha particle travelling through carbon collides with nuclei (scattering) to the energy loss when it collides with bound electrons, we need to consider the different types of interactions that the alpha particle can have with carbon atoms.

When an alpha particle collides with a nucleus, it can either scatter off the nucleus or lose some of its energy through nuclear interactions. The energy loss through nuclear interactions is relatively small compared to the total energy of the alpha particle.

On the other hand, when an alpha particle encounters a bound electron, it can ionize the atom by removing the electron from its orbit. This results in a larger energy loss compared to scattering off a nucleus.

Assuming that the majority of collisions involve interactions with bound electrons rather than nuclei, the ratio of energy loss in scattering with nuclei to that in scattering with bound electrons will be relatively small.

Since we are not given specific numerical values for the energy losses in each type of collision, we cannot determine the exact ratio without more information. However, based on the general principle that scattering with bound electrons results in larger energy losses, we can conclude that the ratio will be less than 1.

Therefore, the most likely answer is D) 1.0 × 10-³, but without more specific information, it is impossible to determine the exact value. </pre>

### ruin_names/242
###### instruction
<pre> Select the humorous edit that 'ruins' the input movie or musical artist name.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'witness'?
Options:
(A) witsess
(B) wetness
(C) wimness
(D) witnpss </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each option step by step:

1. **Original Name**: "Witness"
2. **Option A**: "Witsess"
   - The word "Witsess" is not a real word and doesn't have any obvious humor associated with it.
3. **Option B**: "Wetness"
   - Replacing "Witness" with "Wetness" changes the meaning entirely and introduces a new concept related to moisture, making it a humorous twist on the original word.
4. **Option C**: "Wimness"
   - Similar to "Witsess," "Wimness" is also not a real word and lacks clear humor.
5. **Option D**: "Witnpss"
   - Like "Witsess" and "Wimness," "Witnpss" is nonsensical and does not carry any apparent humor.

**Final Answer**: Option B ("Wetness") is the humorous edit of the movie or artist name "Witness." </pre>

### sports_understanding/34
###### instruction
<pre> Determine whether an artificially constructed sentence relating to sports is plausible or not.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Tom Wilson scored a penalty kick." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. **Tom Wilson** is known as an ice hockey player who currently plays for the Washington Capitals in the NHL.
2. A **penalty kick** is a term used in association football (soccer) when a foul occurs inside the penalty area, resulting in a direct shot on goal from a designated spot.
3. Ice hockey does have penalties but they result in players being sent to the penalty box, not in taking a specific type of kick like in soccer.

Given these points, Tom Wilson scoring a penalty kick is not plausible because it mixes terms from two different sports—ice hockey and soccer.

Final Answer: No </pre>

### disambiguation_qa/100
###### instruction
<pre> Clarify the meaning of sentences with ambiguous pronouns.

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The chief told the counselor that they took the day off.
Options:
(A) The chief took the day off
(B) The counselor took the day off
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "they" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "they", namely the chief and the counselor. The verb "told" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the chief and Y the counselor. The sentence is then of the form "X told Y that (X or Y) did something."
Let's consider Y first: "X told Y that Y did something." This case does not make much sense, as Y would already have the information that Y did something, because it is information about themself.
Now, consider X: "X told Y that X did something." This makes sense, because X would be sharing some information about themself that Y might not have known before.
Because in this context, X is the chief and Y is the counselor, the answer should be the chief. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The manager sent a message to the secretary, but he didn't reply yet.
Options:
(A) The secretary didn't reply yet
(B) The manager didn't reply yet
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "he" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "he", namely the manager and the secretary. The verbs "sent" and "reply" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the manager and Y the secretary. The sentence is then of the form "X sent a message to Y, but (X or Y) didn't reply yet."
Let's consider Y first: "X sent a message to Y, but Y didn't reply yet." This case makes sense, because of the implicit causality of the sentence. Y was the receiver of the message, but Y didn't get back to X yet.
Now, consider X: "X sent a message to Y, but X didn't reply yet." This case doesn't make sense, because X was the initial sender of the message, so it is now Y's turn to write back to X.
Because in this context, X is the manager and Y is the secretary, the answer should be the secretary. So the answer is (A).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: Bailey will plan to meet the director at his office
Options:
(A) It will be Bailey's office
(B) It will be the director's office
(C) Ambiguous
A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "his" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "his", namely Bailey's and the director's. The verb phrase "plan to meet" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be Bailey and Y the director. The sentence is then of the form "X will plan to meet Y at (X or Y)'s office."
Let's consider Y first: "X will plan to meet Y at Y's office." This case makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at Y's office.
Now, consider X: "X will plan to meet Y at X's office." This case also makes sense, because X might want to meet up with Y at X's own office.
Because both X and Y are possible at the same time, we conclude that the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. So the answer is (C).

Q: In the following sentences, explain the antecedent of the pronoun (which thing the pronoun refers to), or state that it is ambiguous.
Sentence: The mechanic greets the receptionist because she was in a good mood.
Options:
(A) The mechanic was in a good mood
(B) The receptionist was in a good mood
(C) Ambiguous </pre>
###### answer
<pre> A: Let's think step by step.
Here we need to determine who the pronoun "she" might be referring to. There are two possible referents for "she," namely the mechanic and the receptionist. The verb "greets" might be able to help us determine which one is more likely (if either). Let X be the mechanic and Y the receptionist. The sentence is then of the form "X greets Y because (X or Y) was in a good mood."

Let's consider Y first: "X greets Y because Y was in a good mood." This case makes sense, because X might greet Y if Y were in a particularly pleasant mood.

Now, consider X: "X greets Y because X was in a good mood." This case also makes sense, because X might choose to greet Y simply because X feels cheerful.

Since both scenarios are plausible, the antecedent of the pronoun is ambiguous. Therefore, the correct option is (C): Ambiguous. </pre>

(1) Turn around: (0, 0), facing the negative y-axis.
(2) Take 1 step: (0, -1), facing the negative y-axis.
(3) Take 6 steps: (0, -7), facing the negative y-axis.
(4) Turn around: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(5) Take 6 steps: (0, -1), facing the positive y-axis.
(6) Take 9 steps: (0, 8), facing the positive y-axis.
(7) Take 1 step: (0, 9), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 9) is not (0, 0), we are not where we started. So the answer is No.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 2 steps right. Take 9 steps left. Take 7 steps right.
Options:

(1) Always face forward: (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
(2) Take 2 steps right: (0, 2), facing the positive y-axis.
(3) Take 9 steps left: (0, -7), facing the positive y-axis.
(4) Take 7 steps right: (0, 7), facing the positive y-axis.
Since (0, 0) is (0, 0), we are indeed where we started. So the answer is Yes.

Q: If you follow these instructions, do you return to the starting point? Always face forward. Take 8 steps right. Take 8 steps left.
Options:

###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the given instructions step-by-step:

1. **Always face forward**: We start at the origin (0, 0), facing the positive y-axis.
2. **Take 8 steps right**: Move 8 units in the positive x-direction: (8, 0).
3. **Take 8 steps left**: Move 8 units in the negative x-direction: (0, 0).

After following all the instructions, we end up at (0, 0). This means that we have returned to our starting position.

### multistep_arithmetic_two/84
###### instruction
<pre> Solve multi-step arithmetic problems.

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((8 + 3 * -8 - -8) - (2 + 2 * -9 - 6)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Давайте решим эту задачу пошагово:

### Шаг 1: Упрощение выражения внутри первой скобки

$$ A = (8 + 3 \cdot -8 - -8) $$

Сначала выполним умножение:

$$ A = (8 + -24 - -8) $$

Теперь сложим числа слева направо:

$$ A = (8 - 24 + 8) $$

$$ A = -16 + 8 $$

$$ A = -8 $$

### Шаг 2: Упрощение выражения во второй скобке

$$ B = (2 + 2 \cdot -9 - 6) $$

Выполним умножение:

$$ B = (2 + -18 - 6) $$

Сложим числа слева направо:

$$ B = (2 - 18 - 6) $$

$$ B = -16 - 6 $$

$$ B = -22 $$

### Шаг 3: Вычисление разности двух выражений

Теперь вычтем значение $B$ из значения $A$:

$$ C = A - B $$

$$ C = -8 - (-22) $$

$$ C = -8 + 22 $$

$$ C = 14 $$

Таким образом, итоговый результат равен 14. </pre>

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a yellow book, a brown book, a white book, an orange book, a black book, a blue book, and a purple book. The black book is the second from the left. The white book is to the right of the orange book. The black book is to the right of the brown book. The yellow book is the third from the right. The purple book is the third from the left. The orange book is the second from the right.
Options:
(A) The yellow book is the second from the right
(B) The brown book is the second from the right
(C) The white book is the second from the right
(D) The orange book is the second from the right
(E) The black book is the second from the right
(F) The blue book is the second from the right
(G) The purple book is the second from the right </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the information provided step-by-step:

1. **The black book is the second from the left**:
   - This means that the first two positions on the shelf must be occupied as follows: "?, Black".
   
2. **The white book is to the right of the orange book**:
   - We can denote this relationship as "Orange, White".

3. **The black book is to the right of the brown book**:
   - This implies that the brown book comes before the black book: "Brown, Black".

4. **The yellow book is the third from the right**:
   - If we count backward from the right, the third position will be occupied by the yellow book.

5. **The purple book is the third from the left**:
   - Counting forward from the left, the third position will be taken by the purple book.

6. **The orange book is the second from the right**:
   - This places the orange book just before the end of the shelf.

Now let's combine all these pieces of information to determine the full arrangement:

- From point 1, we know the first two positions: "?, Black".
- From points 3 and 5, we deduce that the first three positions are: "Brown, ?, Purple".
- Since the black book should follow the brown book, it fits into the second position: "Brown, Black, Purple".
- Points 2 and 6 tell us about the placement of the orange and white books near the end: "Orange, White" with Orange being the second from the right.
- Point 4 tells us that the yellow book is the third from the right, so it goes between the orange and white books: "Yellow, Orange, White".

Finally, the only remaining book is the blue book, which must occupy the fourth position from the left since all other positions have been filled.

So, the complete order of the books on the shelf is:
"Brown, Black, Purple, Blue, Yellow, Orange, White"

From this arrangement, we see that the **second from the right** is indeed the **orange book**. Therefore, the correct answer is:

**(D) The orange book is the second from the right.** </pre>

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In an antique car show, there are three vehicles: a tractor, a station wagon, and a limousine. The tractor is newer than the limousine. The station wagon is the newest.
Options:
(A) The tractor is the oldest
(B) The station wagon is the oldest
(C) The limousine is the oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the information step-by-step:

1. **The tractor is newer than the limousine**: This implies that the limousine is older than the tractor.
   - (oldest) ? Limousine ? Tractor ? (newest)
   
2. **The station wagon is the newest**: This means it comes after both the tractor and the limousine in terms of age.
   - (oldest) ? Limousine ? Tractor ? Station Wagon (newest)

Combining these two points, we can deduce the full order of the vehicles based on their age:
- Oldest: Limousine
- Middle: Tractor
- Newest: Station Wagon

Therefore, the oldest vehicle is the limousine. 

So, the correct answer is (C): The limousine is the oldest. </pre>

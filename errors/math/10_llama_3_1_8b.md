###### answer
<pre> Step 1: Recall the definition of the arcsine function. The arcsine function, denoted by $\arcsin x$, is the inverse of the sine function. It returns the angle whose sine is a given number.

Step 2: We are asked to find $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right)$. This means we need to find the angle whose sine is $-\frac{1}{2}$.

Step 3: Recall the unit circle and the values of sine for common angles. We know that $\sin \left( \frac{\pi}{6} \right) = \frac{1}{2}$.

Step 4: Since the sine function is negative in the third and fourth quadrants, we can find the angle whose sine is $-\frac{1}{2}$ by using the reference angle $\frac{\pi}{6}$ and adding $\pi$ to it.

Step 5: The reference angle is $\frac{\pi}{6}$, so the angle whose sine is $-\frac{1}{2}$ is $\frac{\pi}{6} + \pi = \frac{7\pi}{6}$.

Step 6: Therefore, $\arcsin \left( -\frac{1}{2} \right) = \frac{7\pi}{6}$.

Answer: $\frac{7\pi}{6}$ </pre>

###### answer
<pre> Let $E$ be the point in the rectangle that is equidistant to the four vertices. Then $E$ is the center of the rectangle, which is $O$. Let $F$ be the point in the rectangle that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices. Then $F$ is the point in the rectangle that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices. 

We can draw the perpendicular bisector of $OA$, which is the line $y=x$. The region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is the region that is on the same side of the line $y=x$ as $O$. 

The region that is on the same side of the line $y=x$ as $O$ is the region that is bounded by the lines $y=x$, $y=-x$, $x=250$, and $y=100$. 

The area of the region that is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is $\frac{1}{2}\cdot 400\cdot 400 = 80000$. 

The area of the rectangle is $500\cdot 400 = 200000$. 

The probability that a point is randomly chosen from the interior of rectangle $ABCD$ and is closer to $O$ than to any of the four vertices is $\frac{80000}{200000} = \frac{2}{5}$.

Answer: $\boxed{\frac{2}{5}}$ </pre>

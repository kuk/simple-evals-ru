(F) 12/03/1960
A: Let's think step by step.
If Jane and John married on Jan 2, 1958, then and if it is their 5-year anniversary today, then today's date is Jan 2, 1963. The date tomorrow is Jan 3, 1963, that is 01/03/1963. So the answer is (B).

Q: Jane was born on the last day of Feburary in 2001. Today is her 16-year-old birthday. What is the date one week from today in MM/DD/YYYY?
Options:
(A) 03/08/2017

<pre> Determine whether an artificially constructed sentence relating to sports is plausible or not.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Bam Adebayo scored a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals."
A: Let's think step by step. Bam Adebayo is an American basketball player. Scoring a reverse layup in the Western Conference Finals is part of the NBA Finals. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Santi Cazorla scored a touchdown."
A: Let's think step by step. Santi Cazorla is a soccer player. Touchdown is part of American football and rugby. So the answer is no.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "DeMar DeRozan was called for the goal tend."
A: Let's think step by step. DeMar DeRozan is an American basketball player. Goal tending is part of basketball. So the answer is yes.

Q: Is the following sentence plausible? "Nazem Kadri was out at home." </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step. Nazem Kadri is a professional ice hockey player. "Out at home" is a term used in baseball to describe a player being tagged out while trying to reach home plate. Since Nazem Kadri plays ice hockey, not baseball, the term "out at home" does not apply to his sport. So the answer is no. </pre>

<pre> Answer questions about causal attribution.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
In Bash Ball, opposing teams try to score points in the other team's zone by entering it. On each team, there are two types of players: Bashers and Runners. During the game, Bashers remain in the same spot, trying to hit the other team's Runners with balls, and Runners try to enter the other team's zone without getting hit. Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is not allowed to talk to Runners, Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the remainder of the game. Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
In this scenario, Harmon was hit by a Bash Ball thrown by the opposing team's Basher, which resulted in Harmon being out of the game. The question is whether Harmon's being out of the game was because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was. A typical person would likely consider that while Zach's silence might have contributed to the situation, the direct cause of Harmon being out was the action of the opposing team's Basher who threw the Bash Ball. Zach's decision not to warn Harmon may have increased the risk, but it was not the direct cause of Harmon being hit. Therefore, a typical person would likely answer No, because the immediate cause of Harmon being out was the Basher hitting him with the Bash Ball, not Zach's silence. </pre>

Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'schindler's list'?
Options:
(A) schindler's lift
(B) schindler's list
(C) schindlerm's list
(D) schindler's liit </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
The original name is "Schindler's List". This is the name of a famous movie directed by Steven Spielberg, based on the true story of Oskar Schindler, who saved the lives of more than a thousand mostly Polish-Jewish refugees during the Holocaust by employing them in his factories.

(A) "Schindler's lift": Here the word "list" is changed to "lift". This is a humorous edit because it changes the meaning of the title to something completely different and unexpected, potentially suggesting a movie about elevators rather than a list of names, which is a playful and humorous twist.

(B) "Schindler's list": This is the original name and does not change the original title, so it is not a humorous edit.

(C) "schindlerm's list": Here the word "Schindler's" is changed to "schindlerm's". This is not a humorous edit as it does not change the meaning in a humorous way; it just adds an extra letter 'm' which does not make sense.

(D) "Schindler's liit": Here the word "list" is changed to "liit". This is not a humorous edit as it does not change the meaning in a humorous way; it just misspells "list" which does not add humor.

Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A). </pre>

Options:
(A) The tractor is the oldest
(B) The station wagon is the oldest
(C) The limousine is the oldest </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.

(1) The tractor is newer than the limousine: This means the limousine is older than the tractor.
(2) The station wagon is the newest: This means the station wagon is newer than both the tractor and the limousine.

From (1) and (2), we can deduce the following order from oldest to newest:
- The limousine is older than the tractor.
- The tractor is older than the station wagon.
- The station wagon is the newest.

Therefore, the order from oldest to newest is: limousine, tractor, station wagon.

According to this ordering, the oldest vehicle is the limousine.

(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'midnight cowboy'?
Options:
(A) midnigmht cowboy
(B) midnight cow boy
(C) midnights cowboy
(D) midnight cowbory </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
The original name is "midnight cowboy". This is the name of a classic American film from 1969.
(A) "midnigmht cowboy": Here the word "midnight" is misspelled, but the misspelling does not create a humorous effect.
(B) "midnight cow boy": Here the word "cowboy" is split into "cow" and "boy". This edit creates a humorous effect by changing the meaning and structure of the original title.
(C) "midnights cowboy": Here the word "midnight" is changed to "midnights", which does not create a humorous effect.
(D) "midnight cowbory": Here the word "cowboy" is changed to "cowbory", which does not create a humorous effect.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B). </pre>

Q: ((-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) * (4 + -7 + 0 * -5)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A * B", where A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) and B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5).
Let's calculate A = (-5 + 9 * -4 - 0) = (-5 + (9 * -4) - 0) = (-5 + (-36) - 0) = (-5 + -36 - 0) = -5 - 36 = -41.
Let's calculate B = (4 + -7 + 0 * -5) = (4 + -7 + (0 * -5)) = (4 + -7 + 0) = (4 + -7) = (4 - 7) = -3.
Then, the final equation is A * B = -41 * -3 = (-61) * (-3) = 123. So the answer is 123.

Q: ((-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) + (4 * -9 - 8 - -4)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A + B", where A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) and B = (4 * -9 - 8 - -4).
Let's calculate A = (-9 * 7 * 7 * -9) = ((-9 * 7) * (7 * -9))  = ((-63) * (-63)) = 3969.
Let's calculate B = (4 * -9 - 8 - (-4)) = ((4 * -9) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36) - 8 - (-4)) = ((-36 - 8) - (-4)) = (-44 - (-4)) = -40.
Then, the final equation is A + B = 3969 + -40 = 3969 - 40 = 3929. So the answer is 3929.

Q: ((-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) - (9 - 8 * -7 + -9)) =
A: Let's think step by step.
Let’s recall that the order of operations in mathematics is as follows: (1) Parentheses, (2) exponents, (3) multiplication and division (from left to right), (4) addition and multiplication (from left to right). So, remember to always compute the expressions inside parentheses or brackets first.
This equation can be written as "A - B", where A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) and B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9).
Let's calculate A = (-3 + 5 * 8 * -4) = (-3 + (5 * 8) * -4) = (-3 + (40) * -4) = (-3 + (40 * -4)) = (-3 + -160) = -163.
Let's calculate B = (9 - 8 * -7 + -9) = (9 - (8 * -7) + -9) = (9 - (-56) + -9) = ((9 - (-56)) + -9) = ((65) + -9)= (65 - 9) = 56.
Then, the final equation is A - B = -163 - 56 = -219. So the answer is -219.

Q: ((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) + (9 + -6 + -2 * 5)) = </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's solve this step by step, following the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS).

Given expression: ((-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) + (9 + -6 + -2 * 5))

First, we'll break it down into two parts: A and B, where A = (-8 * 4 + 7 - 5) and B = (9 + -6 + -2 * 5).

Let's calculate A:
A = (-8 * 4 + 7 - 5)
  = (-32 + 7 - 5)  [Multiplication first]
  = (-25 - 5)      [Addition next]
  = -30            [Subtraction]

Now, let's calculate B:
B = (9 + -6 + -2 * 5)
  = (9 - 6 - 10)   [Multiplication first]
  = (3 - 10)       [Addition next]
  = -7            [Subtraction]

Finally, we add A and B:
A + B = -30 + (-7) = -37

So, the final answer is -37. </pre>

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Frank T., had an ongoing dispute with his neighbor over a stretch of land and one day decided to shoot his neighbor in the body. Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild. Nonetheless, the bullet bounced off a large boulder several feet away and hit the neighbor's body, causing significant injury. Did Frank T. intentionally shoot his neighbor in the body?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "Frank T. had no experience with guns, his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and the shot went wild." A typical person would assume that this passage suggests that Frank T. had no intention of shooting and injuring someone and that the bullet accidentally hit the neighbor's body; therefore, we conclude that Frank T. did not intentionally hit his neighbor. So the answer is No.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that the boss ordered them both to arrive at the meeting room at the same time and that the motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time." A typical person would assume that the person probably meant to say the detector was set up to be triggered if "both persons" appeared in the room at the same time, not at least one person, since otherwise the phrase "at the same time" would not make much sense in that sentence. Because the motion detector went off, a typical person would therefore come to the conclusion that both Suzy and Billy triggered the motion detector to go off; hence, Billy did indeed cause the motion detector to go off. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
George and his sister Lena reunite at their parents' house for Thanksgiving. Whereas George just got into medical school, Lena is unhappy in her marriage and recently lost her job. Over the course of the day, George and Lena get into a number of heated arguments. Later in the afternoon they play a game of darts. They split the first two games, and the third game is close until the end. Who will win comes down to George's last shot. If he hits a high point region, he wins; if he hits a low point region, Lena wins. George thinks of the difficult time Lena is having, and he really wants to let her win. He aims the dart at the low point region. He sets up his shot and the dart lands in the low point region. After his shot, Lena wins the game and is very happy. Did George hit the low point region intentionally?
Options:
- Yes
- No
A: Let's think step by step.
Here in this question, we are told that "He aims the dart at the low point region." A typical person might therefore think George did intentionally hit the low point region, because he wanted to lift up the spirit of his sister Lena. So the answer is Yes.

Q: How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A lieutenant was talking with a sergeant. The lieutenant gave the order: 'Send your squad to the top of Thompson Hill.' The sergeant said: 'But if I send my squad to the top of Thompson Hill, we'll be moving the men directly into the enemy's line of fire. Some of them will surely be killed!' The lieutenant answered: 'Look, I know that they'll be in the line of fire, and I know that some of them will be killed. But I don't care at all about what happens to our soldiers. All I care about is taking control of Thompson Hill.' The squad was sent to the top of Thompson Hill. As expected, the soldiers were moved into the enemy's line of fire, and some of them were killed. Did the lieutenant intentionally put the soldiers in the line of fire?
Options:
- Yes
- No </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's think step by step.
In this scenario, the lieutenant is aware that sending the squad to the top of Thompson Hill would put them in the enemy's line of fire and that some of them would be killed. Despite this knowledge, the lieutenant still gave the order, showing a clear disregard for the soldiers' safety in favor of achieving the objective of taking control of Thompson Hill. A typical person would likely conclude that the lieutenant's actions were intentional in the sense that he knowingly and deliberately ordered the squad into a dangerous situation. Therefore, the answer is Yes. </pre>

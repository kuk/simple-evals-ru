### ruin_names/33
###### instruction
<pre> Select the humorous edit that 'ruins' the input movie or musical artist name.

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'whitesnake'?
Options:
(A) whitesnape
(B) whitesnapke
(C) whitesnuake
(D) mwhitesnake
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "whitesnake". This is the name of an old English hard rock band. It is a compound word, formed by the words "white" and "snake".
(A) "whitesnape": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snake"; therefore, "snake" has been changed to "snape". Snape makes a reference to the fictional character Severus Snape in the Harry Potter series, so (A) is indeed a meaningful and funny edit.
(B) "whitesnapke": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snapke", but "snapke" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnapke" is not humorous.
(C) "whitesnuake": It is formed by the combination of "white" and "snuake", but "snuake" is not an actual word; therefore, "whitesnuake" is not humorous.
(D) "mwhitesnake": It is formed by the combination of "m", "white", and "snake", but the prefix "-m "seems arbitrary; therefore, "mwhitesnake" is not meaningful or humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (A). So the answer is (A).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'one of our dinosaurs is missing'?
Options:
(A) ofne of our dinosaurs is missing
(B) one af our dinosaurs is missing
(C) one of our dinosaurs is pissing
(D) one of our dinosaur is missing
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "one of our dinosaurs is missing". This is the name of an old British movie.
(A) "ofne of our dinosaurs is missing": Here "one of" is changed to "ofne", but the word "ofne" is not an actual word.
(B) "one af our dinosaurs is missing": Here the word "of" is changed to "af", but the word "af" is not an actual word.
(C) "one of our dinosaurs is pissing": Here the word "missing" is changed to "pissing", and "one of our dinosaurs is pissing" is indeed a very whimsical and mischievous edit. This change truly ruins the original title of the movie.
(D) "one of our dinosaur is missing": Here the word "dinosaurs" is changed to "dinosaur", but "dinosaur" is singular but should be plural in the title; this change therefore feels arbitrary and not humorous.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C).
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (C). So the answer is (C).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'counting crows'?
Options:
(A) countingy crows
(B) counting cows
(C) courting crows
(D) coutnting crows
A: Let's think step by step.
The original name is "counting crows". This is the name of an American rock band. Historically, the band name comes from the British nursery rhyme "One for Sorrow", which is about counting of magpies.
(A) "countingy crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "countingy", but the word "countingy" is not an actual word.
(B) "counting cows": Here the word "crows" is changed to "cows", and this is indeed a playful and meaningful edit that ruins the original name of the band.
(C) "courting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "courting", and "courting" is an actual word; however, "courting crows" does not sound as humorous as "counting cows".
(D) "coutnting crows": Here the word "counting" is changed to "coutnting", but the word "coutnting" is not an actual word.
Above the above, the only humorous edit is (B). So the answer is (B).

Q: Which of the following is a humorous edit of this artist or movie name: 'die another day'?
Options:
(A) die anothpr day
(B) diet another day
(C) dies another day
(D) die another ay </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the humorous edit, let's analyze each option:

The original name is "die another day". 

(A) "die anothpr day": The word "another" is changed to "anothpr", which is not an actual word.
(B) "diet another day": The word "die" is changed to "diet", which is an actual word, but it's unlikely to be humorous in this context.
(C) "dies another day": The word "die" is changed to "dies", which is an actual word that changes the meaning of the title. However, it's not clear whether this is meant to be humorous.
(D) "die another ay": The word "day" is changed to "ay", which is an actual word, but it's not clear what connection it has to the original title.

A possible humorous edit could be a word that changes the original title, making it sound nonsensical or unexpected.

Among the options, (C) "dies another day" is the only one that definitely changes the original title, and "dies" does sound somewhat humorous. The joke here is that "dies" changes the meaning of the title from "die another day" (a phrase meaning to postpone or delay something) to "dies another day" (a phrase making literal sense in the context of death).

So, the answer is (C). </pre>

### logical_deduction_seven_objects/9
###### instruction
<pre> A logical deduction task which requires deducing the order of a sequence of objects.

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. In a golf tournament, there were three golfers: Amy, Eli, and Eve. Eve finished above Amy. Eli finished below Amy.
Options:
(A) Amy finished last
(B) Eli finished last
(C) Eve finished last
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) Eve finished above Amy: "(above) ? Eve ? Amy ? (below)".
(2) Eli finished below Amy: "(above) ? Amy ? Eli ? (below)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(above) Eve Amy Eli (below)".
According to this ordering, the person who finished last (the one at the bottom of this list) is Eli.
Eli finished last. So the answer is (B).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph.

A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The green book is to the right of the white book: "(left) ? white ? green ? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the rightmost: "(left) ? white ? green orange (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white green orange (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (A).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of three objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are three books: a red book, a gray book, and a white book. The white book is to the left of the gray book. The red book is the second from the left.
Options:
(A) The red book is the leftmost
(B) The gray book is the leftmost
(C) The white book is the leftmost
A: Let's think step by step.
(1) The white book is to the left of the gray book: "(left) ? white ? gray ? (right)".
(2) The red book is the second from the left: "(left) ? white red gray ? (right)".
(3) Combining (1) and (2) we get the following ordering: "(left) white red gray (right)".
According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the white book.
The white book is the leftmost. So the answer is (C).

Q: The following paragraphs each describe a set of seven objects arranged in a fixed order. The statements are logically consistent within each paragraph. On a shelf, there are seven books: a brown book, a yellow book, a black book, a white book, a green book, an orange book, and a purple book. The purple book is the rightmost. The yellow book is the leftmost. The orange book is the second from the right. The brown book is to the left of the green book. The brown book is to the right of the black book. The white book is the fourth from the left.
Options:
(A) The brown book is the leftmost
(B) The yellow book is the leftmost
(C) The black book is the leftmost
(D) The white book is the leftmost
(E) The green book is the leftmost
(F) The orange book is the leftmost
(G) The purple book is the leftmost </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze the statements:

(1) The yellow book is the leftmost: "(left)? yellow????? (right)".
(2) The orange book is the second from the right: "(left)? yellow???? orange (right)".
(3) The purple book is the rightmost: "(left)? yellow???? orange purple (right)".
(4) The white book is the fourth from the left: "(left)? yellow white???? orange purple (right)".
(5) The brown book is to the left of the green book: "(left)? yellow white brown green??? orange purple (right)".
(6) The brown book is to the right of the black book: "(left)? yellow white brown black green??? orange purple (right)".

From (5) and (6), we can conclude that the black book is to the left of the brown book, and the brown book is to the left of the green book. Therefore, the correct order is:

"(left) black brown green yellow white?? orange purple (right)".

According to this ordering, the leftmost book is the black book.

The correct answer is (C). </pre>

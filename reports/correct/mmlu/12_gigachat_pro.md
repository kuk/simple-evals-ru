\lim_{x \to 1}(1/(x - 1) - c/(x^3 - 1)) exists. What is the value of c?

B) 1
C) 5
D) 1/2
E) 2
F) 0
G) 4
H) -1
I) 3
J) 3/2 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the value of $c$ for which the limit $\lim_{x \to 1} \left(\frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{x^3 - 1}\right)$ exists, we need to analyze the behavior of the expression as $x$ approaches 1.

First, let's simplify the expression inside the limit:
$$\frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{x^3 - 1}.$$

We can combine these two fractions over a common denominator:
$$\frac{1}{x - 1} - \frac{c}{x^3 - 1} = \frac{(x^3 - 1) - c(x - 1)}{(x - 1)(x^3 - 1)}.$$

Next, factor the numerator and the denominator:
- The denominator $(x - 1)(x^3 - 1)$ can be factored further into $(x - 1)(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$.
- For the numerator, notice that $x^3 - 1$ can be expressed as $(x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1)$. So, it becomes:
  $$(x^3 - 1) - c(x - 1) = (x - 1)(x^2 + x + 1) - c(x - 1).$$

Now, we can factor out $(x - 1)$ from both terms in the numerator:
$$= (x - 1)((x^2 + x + 1) - c).$$

For the original expression to have a finite limit as $x \to 1$, the numerator must approach zero:
$$(x^2 + x + 1) - c = 0.$$

Solving for $c$:
$$x^2 + x + 1 - c = 0.$$
Substitute $x = 1$ into this equation:
$$1^2 + 1 + 1 - c = 0,$$
$$3 - c = 0,$$
$$c = 3.$$

So, the value of $c$ that makes the limit exist is $3$.

Consider the gas phase thermal decomposition of 1.0 atm of $\left(\mathrm{CH}_3\right)_3 \mathrm{COOC}\left(\mathrm{CH}_3\right)_3(\mathrm{~g})$ to acetone $\left(\mathrm{CH}_3\right)_2 \mathrm{CO}(\mathrm{g})$ and ethane $\left(\mathrm{C}_2 \mathrm{H}_6\right)(\mathrm{g})$, which occurs with a rate constant of $0.0019 \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$. After initiation of the reaction, at what time would you expect the pressure to be $1.8 \mathrm{~atm}$ ?

A) 100 s
B)  269 $\mathrm{~s}$
C) 400 s
D) 300 $\mathrm{~s}$
E) 600 s
F) 500 s
G) 200 $\mathrm{~s}$
H) 450 s
I) 150 s
J) 350 $\mathrm{~s}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's break down the problem step-by-step to understand how to solve it:

1. **Understand the Reaction**: We are given the thermal decomposition of (CH₃)₃COOC(CH₃)₃ to form (CH₃)₂CO and C₂H₆. This can be represented as:
   

$$
   (\text{CH}_3)_3\text{COOC}(\text{CH}_3)_3 \rightarrow (\text{CH}_3)_2\text{CO} + \text{C}_2\text{H}_6
   $$

2. **Initial Pressure and Rate Constant**: Initially, we have 1.0 atm of the reactant. The reaction has a rate constant ($k$) of $0.0019 \, \text{s}^{-1}$.

3. **Pressure Change Over Time**: As the reaction proceeds, the concentration of the reactant decreases, and the concentrations of products increase. Since the initial pressure is 1.0 atm, let’s assume that when the total pressure becomes 1.8 atm, the mixture contains 0.8 atm of products (each product forming 0.4 atm). Therefore, the remaining reactant's pressure will be $1.8 - 0.4 = 1.4$ atm.

4. **Use of Integrated Rate Law**: To find out how long it takes for the pressure to change from 1.0 atm to 1.4 atm (which corresponds to a certain amount of reactant being consumed), we use the integrated first-order rate law:
   

$$
   \ln[A]_t = \ln[A]_0 - kt
   $$

   Here, $[A]_0$ is the initial pressure (1.0 atm), $[A]_t$ is the pressure at time $t$, $k$ is the rate constant (0.0019 s⁻¹), and $t$ is the time in seconds.

5. **Calculation**: Plugging in the values, we get:
   

$$
   \ln(1.4) = \ln(1.0) - (0.0019)(t)
   $$

   

$$
   \ln(1.4) = -0.0019t
   $$

   

$$
   t = \frac{\ln(1.4)}{-0.0019}
   $$

6. **Solve for $t$**: Calculating this gives us approximately:
   

$$
   t \approx 269 \, \text{seconds}
   $$

So, after about 269 seconds, the pressure is expected to reach 1.8 atm.

**Final Answer: B) 269 s** </pre>

The owner of a competitive firm making zero economic profit

A) should lower her prices to increase profits
B) should consider shutting down because she could make more elsewhere
C) is making a loss and should consider changing her business strategy
D) is earning exceptionally high profits
E) is not making any profit at all
F) should consider expanding her business for more profit
G) is making less than normal profits
H) will most likely make more profits in the long run
I) is making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative job
J) is making more than what she would make in her next best alternative job </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each option step-by-step:

1. **Option A**: "should lower her prices to increase profits"
   - This option suggests that the firm is trying to increase profits by lowering prices. However, if the firm is already making zero economic profit, lowering prices further wouldn’t make sense as it would result in even lower profit or increased losses.

2. **Option B**: "should consider shutting down because she could make more elsewhere"
   - If the firm were facing losses, this might be an option. But since the firm is making zero economic profit, it means it is covering its total costs. So, there's no indication that the owner could make more elsewhere.

3. **Option C**: "is making a loss and should consider changing her business strategy"
   - Making a loss means incurring more expenses than revenues, which results in negative profit. Zero economic profit means the firm's revenues are just enough to cover its total costs (including opportunity costs). Therefore, it isn’t making a loss.

4. **Option D**: "is earning exceptionally high profits"
   - High profits would imply that the firm is earning more than necessary to cover its costs, including opportunity costs. Zero economic profit means the firm is just breaking even; hence, it isn’t earning exceptionally high profits.

5. **Option E**: "is not making any profit at all"
   - While zero economic profit technically means not making any profit when considering opportunity costs, this description doesn’t specify that it includes these costs. It still aligns with the given situation though.

6. **Option F**: "should consider expanding her business for more profit"
   - Expanding a business is typically motivated by higher profits or growth opportunities. With zero economic profit, expanding may not be the immediate priority unless other factors like market conditions or strategic positioning favor such a move.

7. **Option G**: "is making less than normal profits"
   - Normal profits refer to the minimum return required to stay in business. Zero economic profit implies that the firm is making exactly enough to cover its costs, so it isn’t making less than normal profits.

8. **Option H**: "will most likely make more profits in the long run"
   - There's no information provided to suggest that the firm will do better in the future without additional context on industry trends, market conditions, or potential improvements in efficiency.

9. **Option I**: "is making exactly what she would make in her next best alternative job"
   - This describes the concept of opportunity cost, which is factored into the idea of zero economic profit. Thus, this fits well with the scenario described.

10. **Option J**: "is making more than what she would make in her next best alternative job"
    - Since zero economic profit already accounts for opportunity costs, this does not apply.

Final answer based on the analysis: 

Zero economic profit indicates that the firm is making a normal profit—just enough to cover all costs, including implicit costs (opportunity costs). Hence, the correct option must reflect that while the firm is making zero profit in an accounting sense, it covers its opportunity costs precisely.

___________ is a communication disorder that is characterized by difficulties in regulating the rate, rhythm, pitch, and loudness of speech.

A) Dysprosody
B) Paraphasia
C) Aphasia
D) Dysarthria
E) Dyspraxia
F) Dyslexia
G) Dysphonia
H) Dysphagia
I) Adynamia
J) Apraxia </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, we need to analyze each option to see which one corresponds to a communication disorder characterized by difficulties in regulating the rate, rhythm, pitch, and loudness of speech.

- **A) Dysprosody**: This term refers to abnormal prosody in speech, which includes issues with rhythm, intonation, stress, and timing. Prosody is very important for conveying emotions, tone, and emphasis in speech. Thus, dysprosodia would fit the description provided.

- **B) Paraphasia**: This is a condition where an individual substitutes one word or phrase with another, often causing semantic or phonemic errors. It does not specifically address problems with speech regulation in terms of rate, rhythm, pitch, and loudness.

- **C) Aphasia**: This is an impairment of language, typically affecting the ability to produce or comprehend spoken or written language, but it does not primarily describe issues with the vocal characteristics like rate or rhythm.

- **D) Dysarthria**: This disorder results from weakness or poor coordination of the muscles involved in speech production, such as those controlling the lips, tongue, palate, and larynx. Although dysarthria can affect speech clarity, it mainly involves neuromuscular weakness rather than issues with regulating speech patterns like rate or rhythm.

- **E) Dyspraxia**: Also known as apraxia, this is a neurological disorder where individuals have difficulty performing purposeful movements, including those required for speech. However, it doesn’t particularly focus on the aspects of rate, rhythm, etc., mentioned in the question.

- **F) Dyslexia**: This learning disability primarily affects reading skills, involving difficulties with decoding, spelling, and recognition. It has no direct relation to the characteristics described in the question.

- **G) G) Dysphonia**: This term describes any voice disorder that changes the sound or resonance of the voice. While related to voice, it does not necessarily encompass issues with rate, rhythm, pitch, or loudness.

- **H) H) Dysphagia**: This is a swallowing disorder and is unrelated to speech production or vocal characteristics.

- **I) Adynamia**: This refers to a lack of strength or energy and isn't directly associated with communication disorders.

- **J) Apraxia**: As previously mentioned under E), apraxia generally deals with difficulty executing learned, purposeful movements rather than specific speech characteristics.

After analyzing all options, the most appropriate choice is:

Suppose that $A, B$, and $C$ are mutually independent events and that $P(A)=0.5, P(B)=0.8$, and $P(C)=$ 0.9 . Find the probabilities that all three events occur?

A) 0.9
B)  0.36

E) 0.24
F) 0.1
G) 0.3
H) 0.58
I) 0.5
J) 0.45 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this problem, we need to find the probability that all three independent events $A$, $B$, and $C$ occur simultaneously. Since the events are independent, the probability of their intersection can be found by multiplying their individual probabilities.

Given:
- $P(A) = 0.5$
- $S(B) = 0.8$
- $P(C) = 0.9$

The probability that all three events occur is given by:
$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = P(A) \times P(B) \times P(C)$$

Substitute the given values:
$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.5 \times 0.8 \times 0.9$$

Calculate the product:
$$P(A \cap B \cap C) = 0.5 \times 0.8 \times 0.9 = 0.36$$

So, the probability that all three events occur is $0.36$.

G) migration diffusion.
H) push factors.

###### answer
<pre> To determine the correct answer, let's analyze each option:

1. **Gravity Model**: This model is related to population density and migration patterns, often comparing them to gravitational forces. It doesn’t specifically address the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.
2. **Migration Selectivity**: This term refers to how certain groups are more likely to migrate than others, not specifically about the relationship between migration and distance.
3. **Geographic Isolation**: Refers to areas being cut off from other areas due to physical barriers, which isn't directly about the tendency for migration to decrease with distance.
4. **Demographic Transition**: Describes changes in birth and death rates as a country develops, not focused on distance and migration.
5. **Spatial Distribution**: Deals with how things are distributed across space but does not explicitly refer to migration decreasing with distance.
6. **Distance Decay**: Specifically refers to the phenomenon where interaction between locations decreases as the distance between them increases. This fits the description given in the question.
7. **Migration Diffusion**: Related to the spread of migration flows over time, it does not focus on distance.
8. **Push Factors**: These are reasons causing people to leave an area, such as war or famine, rather than referring to the relationship between migration and distance.
9. **Friction of Distance**: Similar to distance decay, this concept describes how distance makes interaction harder and less frequent, making it another good fit for what the question describes.
10. **Pull Factors**: These attract people to a new location, again not specifically about the relationship between migration and distance.

After analyzing all options, we can conclude that both "distance decay" and "friction of distance" accurately describe the tendency for migration to decrease with distance. However, since "distance decay" is a more commonly used term in this context, I will choose that.

based upon rewardor punishment or based upon a need to know. Distinguish on a more specific plane between the three kinds ofresponses to social influence.

A) Respect, imitation, and socialization
B) Acquiescence, imitation, and enculturation
C) Agreement, alliance, and absorption
D) Cooperation, imitation, and assimilation
E) Submission, emulation, and inculcation
F) Adherence, affiliation, and incorporation
G) Compliance, identification, and internalization
H) Conformity, association, and adaptation
I) Coordination, assimilation, and conformation
J) Obedience, integration, and acculturation </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To distinguish between the three kinds of responses to social influence, we need to analyze each option provided:

1. **Respect, imitation, and socialization** 
   - "Respect" implies a positive regard towards an individual or entity which influences behavior but isn’t necessarily about conforming to social pressure.
   - "Imitation" can imply copying others' behaviors, often due to admiration or perceived benefits.
   - "Socialization" refers broadly to learning the norms and values of society; it doesn't directly relate to immediate reactions to social influence.

2. **Acquiescence, imitation, and enculturation**
   - "Acquiescence" means passive acceptance or yielding to external pressure or influence.
   - "Imitation" as previously mentioned involves copying others.
   - "Enculturation" specifically refers to the process of transmitting culture or learned societal norms.

3. **Agreement, alliance, and absorption**
   - "Agreement" suggests consent or concurrence with another person or group.
   - "Alliance" indicates forming partnerships or coalitions.
   - "Absorption" could mean taking in ideas or becoming part of a larger group, but it might not clearly align with typical forms of responding to social influence.

4. **Cooperation, imitation, and assimilation**
   - "Cooperation" requires working together for mutual benefit.
   - "Imitation" again involves copying others.
   - "Assimilation" describes adapting and integrating into a different environment or culture fully.

5. **Submission, emulation, and inculcation**
   - "Submission" implies yielding to authority or power.
   - "Emulation" is similar to imitation but may have a stronger sense of aspiration or idealization.
   - "Inculcation" means instilling beliefs, attitudes, or ideologies through persistent guidance or teaching.

6. **Adherence, affiliation, and incorporation**
   - "Adherence" suggests sticking to rules or guidelines.
   - "Affiliation" relates to forming connections or associations.
   - "Incorporation" means including or integrating something within a whole.

7. **Compliance, identification, and internalization**
   - "Compliance" implies adhering to requests or demands from an authority figure or dominant group.
   - "Identification" involves modeling oneself after someone else.
   - "Internalization" means making external norms or values part of one's own belief system.

8. **Conformity, association, and adaptation**
   - "Conformity" suggests matching one's behavior to group norms.
   - "Association" implies connecting with others.
   - "Adaptation" means adjusting to new conditions or environments.

9. **Coordination, assimilation, and conformation**
   - "Coordination" involves synchronizing actions with others.
   - "Assimilation" has been covered earlier.
   - "Conformation" generally means confirming or verifying something, less relevant here.

10. **Obedience, integration, and acculturation**
    - "Obedience" implies following orders or instructions.
    - "Integration" suggests combining parts into a unified whole.
    - "Acculturation" refers to adopting the cultural traits of another group.

After analyzing all options, the best fit for distinguishing between types of responses to social influence based on reward/punishment or need-to-know would involve terms that reflect compliance, internalization, and deeper psychological processes rather than mere superficial copying or cooperation.

The most fitting answer is:

**G) Compliance, identification, and internalization**

These terms cover a range from surface-level adherence to deep psychological integration of social influences. </pre>

The nucleus of a plutonium-239 atom contains 94 protons. Assume that the nucleus is a sphere with radius $6.64 \mathrm{fm}$ and with the charge of the protons uniformly spread through the sphere. At the surface of the nucleus, what are the magnitude of the electric field produced by the protons?

I) $1.92 \times 10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$
J) $4.10$$10^{21} \mathrm{~N} / \mathrm{C}$ </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To determine the magnitude of the electric field at the surface of the nucleus, we need to use Coulomb's law for electrostatics. According to this law, the electric field strength ($E$) due to a point charge at a distance $r$ from the center can be given by:

$$ E = k \frac{Q}{r^2} $$

where $k$ is Coulomb's constant ($8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2$), and $Q$ is the total charge creating the electric field.

In this problem, we have a uniform distribution of charge (protons) on the surface of a spherical nucleus. Each proton has a charge of $+e$, where $e = 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C}$. Given there are 94 protons in a plutonium-239 nucleus, the total charge $Q$ is:

$$ Q = 94 \times e = 94 \times 1.602 \times 10^{-19} \, \text{C} = 1.50588 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{C} $$

The radius of the nucleus ($r$) is given as $6.64 \, \text{fm}$, which needs to be converted to meters for the units to match in Coulomb's formula. Since $1 \, \text{fm} = 10^{-15} \, \text{m}$:

$$ r = 6.64 \, \text{fm} \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m/fm} = 6.64 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m} $$

Now substituting these values into Coulomb’s equation:

$$ E = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 \times \frac{1.50588 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{C}}{(6.64 \times 10^{-15} \, \text{m})^2} $$

Simplifying the calculations step-by-step:

$$ E = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 \times \frac{1.50588 \times 10^{-17} \, \text{C}}{4.40976 \times 10^{-29} \, \text{m}^2} $$

$$ E = 8.99 \times 10^9 \, \text{N m}^2/\text{C}^2 \times 3.416 \times 10^{11} \, \text{C}/\text{m}^2 $$

$$ E = 3.07 \times 10^{21} \, \text{N}/\text{C} $$

Thus, the magnitude of the electric field at the surface of the nucleus is $3.07 \times 10^{21} \, \text{N}/\text{C}$.

E) ¬B ⊃ W
F) W ⊃ B
G) B ∨ W
H) W ∨ B
I) Both A and B
J) B ≡ ¬W </pre>
###### answer
<pre> Let's analyze each option step-by-step to see which one best symbolizes the sentence "If Beth rides her bike, she gets to work earlier."

1. **Option A**: B ≡ W
   - This translates to "Beth riding her bike if and only if she gets to work earlier."
   - This suggests that both events happen together, which doesn't fit well with the "if... then" structure of the original sentence.

2. **Option B**: B & W
   - This means "Beth rides her bike and she gets to work earlier."
   - It implies both conditions always occur together, not just one after the other.

3. **Option C**: B ⊃ W
   - This reads as "If Beth rides her bike, then she gets to work earlier."
   - This matches closely with the original sentence structure and logic.

4. **Option D**: ¬W ⊃ B
   - This can be read as "If Beth does not get to work earlier, then she rides her bike."
   - This seems to reverse the cause and effect described in the original sentence.

5. **Option E**: ¬B ⊃ W
   - Translating to "If Beth does not ride her bike, then she gets to work earlier."
   - Again, this reverses the cause and effect.

6. **Option F**: W ⊃ B
   - Means "If Beth gets to work earlier, then she rides her bike."
   - This also reverses the cause and effect.

7. **Option G**: B ∨ W
   - States "Beth rides her bike or she gets to work earlier."
   - Suggests that either event occurs without specifying any relationship between them.

8. **Option H**: W ∨ B
   - Implies "Beth gets to work earlier or she rides her bike."
   - Similar to Option G, it states they are possible but doesn’t imply a causal link.

9. **Option I**: Both A and B
   - Combining Options A and B would mean Beth must ride her bike exactly when she gets to work earlier.
   - This contradicts natural expectations since there could be days she walks or takes public transport.

10. **Option J**: B ≡ ¬W
    - Says "Beth riding her bike if and only if she does not get to work earlier."
    - This conflicts with the meaning of the original sentence.

After analyzing all options, we conclude that:

**Option C** (B ⊃ W): If Beth rides her bike, then she gets to work earlier, is the best representation of the given sentence.

D) 5.000

F) 4.567
G) 6.778
H) 7.789
I) 9.354
J) 5.667 </pre>
###### answer
<pre> To solve this differential equation, we need to integrate both sides with respect to t.

Given:
\[
\frac{dy}{dt} = \sqrt{t}
\]
This can be rewritten as:
\[
dy = \sqrt{t} \, dt
\]
Now, integrating both sides:
\[
y = \int \sqrt{t} \, dt
\]
The integral of $\sqrt{t}$ is $\frac{2}{3} t^{3/2}$. So, we have:
\[
y = \frac{2}{3} t^{3/2} + C
\]
where C is a constant of integration. We are given the initial condition that $y(1) = 1$. Plugging in these values:
\[
1 = \frac{2}{3} (1)^{3/2} + C
\]
Simplifying:
\[
1 = \frac{2}{3} + C
\]
Solving for C:
\[
C = 1 - \frac{2}{3} = \frac{1}{3}
\]
So, our function becomes:
\[
y = \frac{2}{3} t^{3/2} + \frac{1}{3}
\]
To find $y(4)$, we substitute $t = 4$ into our equation:
\[
y(4) = \frac{2}{3} (4)^{3/2} + \frac{1}{3}
\]
Calculating each term separately:
\[
(4)^{3/2} = 8
\]
Thus:
\[
y(4) = \frac{2}{3} \cdot 8 + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{16}{3} + \frac{1}{3} = 5\frac{2}{3}
\]
Converting to decimal form:
\[
5\frac{2}{3} = 5.667
\]
